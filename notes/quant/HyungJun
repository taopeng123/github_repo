Hi Tao, it's nice that you find the book useful. I was sure that you would find it more useful than I did. The senior student is Jianjia Fei, and he just got graduated after an internship at KCG. And a few years ago, another guy (Yongyan (Will) Rao) in Tao Han's group went to finance after graduation. He has a linkedin profile as well. Thanks.
