00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,955
Now that you have a solid foundation in Neural Networks,

2
00:00:02,955 --> 00:00:06,570
we are excited to teach you about convolutional neural networks.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,330
I'm happy to introduce you to Alexis Cook, an expert in the subject.

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,359
Hi everyone. I'm Alexis.

5
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:13,980
Over the next several videos,

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,814
I'll help you learn more about Convolutional Neural Networks,

7
00:00:16,814 --> 00:00:19,480
which we'll also refer to as CNNs.

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,199
For now, let's investigate some of their fascinating applications.
