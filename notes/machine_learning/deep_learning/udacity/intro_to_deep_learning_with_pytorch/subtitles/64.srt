00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
So, today I'm joined by Soumith Chintala who works at Facebook AI Research,

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,785
and is the creator of PyTorch.

3
00:00:06,785 --> 00:00:11,270
I want to start this interview by asking you how you got your start in AI research.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,025
What got you interested in the field?

5
00:00:13,025 --> 00:00:17,130
Sure. I always wanted to be a visual effects artist,

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,665
at least when I started my undergrad,

7
00:00:19,665 --> 00:00:23,835
and then I interned at a place and they said, "You're not good enough."

8
00:00:23,835 --> 00:00:24,915
No.

9
00:00:24,915 --> 00:00:27,090
I was like in the art angle.

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,970
So, I was good at programming since I was a kid,

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,790
so I tried to find the next most magical thing and that was computer vision.

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,645
To me it was really compelling that you could just

13
00:00:40,645 --> 00:00:47,410
magically stitch things together and your programs could understand what a code is,

14
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,075
what visual concepts are.

15
00:00:50,075 --> 00:00:51,380
That's how I got started.

16
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,200
I basically tried to do stuff online,

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,020
but Udacity wasn't around back then,

18
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,695
so I had to find a professor in India,

19
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:04,040
which is really hard to who's doing this kind of stuff,

20
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,540
and there's just like one or two.

21
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,125
I spent six months with the professor's lab.

22
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:12,870
I started picking up some things,

23
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,250
then went to CMU,

24
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,245
tried my hand at robotics.

25
00:01:16,245 --> 00:01:22,440
Then finally I landed at NYU in Yann LeCun's lab doing deep learning,

26
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,470
where I did ask him what are neural networks because I frankly didn't know.

27
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,820
Yeah, you need a place to start.

28
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,180
Yeah. So, that's how I got started.

29
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,670
What motivates me is this;

30
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:40,990
how do we make computers understand the world the way we see it?

31
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,870
That just seems pretty magical to me and I want to get there.

32
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,235
I completely agree.

33
00:01:46,235 --> 00:01:49,610
So, it sounds like your journey here was an exploratory one,

34
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:54,825
would have been by curiosity and sort of having this idea of graphics in mind.

35
00:01:54,825 --> 00:01:59,090
I wonder how you ended up feeling motivated to create

36
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,560
something like PyTorch and this kind of new usable defining framework.

37
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,514
Sure. Since I got to NYU,

38
00:02:06,514 --> 00:02:11,375
I've been working on building up tooling for deep learning.

39
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:15,770
I worked on this project called EBLearn which was

40
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:21,225
like two generations before in terms of deep learning framework timelines.

41
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:26,840
I started there, as that was my first tool to do deep learning research.

42
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,405
It was very hard.

43
00:02:29,405 --> 00:02:31,250
Every time we kicked off a program,

44
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,870
it would take 15 minutes,

45
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,270
and then came around Torch,

46
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,205
which is written by a few people who I knew.

47
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:41,430
Then I started getting pretty active and

48
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,780
helping people out using Torch and then delving on Torch.

49
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,680
That was mostly, again,

50
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,460
I wanted to do my research and then help other people do their research well.

51
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:58,220
At some point, we decided that we needed a new tool because as

52
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:03,770
the field moves the tools that you need to make research progress change as well.

53
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,100
So, you can take a tool from the 90s and say,

54
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,630
"Hey, I'll do my research on that",

55
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:14,730
because fundamental flexibilities, the ideas you need to express, they keep changing.

56
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,760
So, in end of 2016,

57
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,885
we decided that was the time, again,

58
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:27,240
and so I went about building PyTorch mostly because we

59
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,525
had a really stressful project that was really large and hard to build in Torch.

60
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:34,670
What was it that you are working on,

61
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,720
if you don't mind telling me?

62
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,355
It's around object detection.

63
00:03:37,355 --> 00:03:40,745
We were trying to enter the cocoa detection challenge.

64
00:03:40,745 --> 00:03:42,210
Yes.

65
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,050
Our network was really complicated,

66
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,060
it had multiple subsystems,

67
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,940
and it was not always differentiable.

68
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,930
It was this really humongous thing and Torch wasn't the right tool.

69
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,460
Then we briefly gave Transic a little try,

70
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,065
but then it didn't go with our sensibilities.

71
00:04:02,065 --> 00:04:05,415
So, after that project was done,

72
00:04:05,415 --> 00:04:08,185
we had some self-recollection,

73
00:04:08,185 --> 00:04:13,130
and me and a couple of other people decided to just build PyTorch.

74
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,955
Yeah, that makes sense. I think I also find it very true where

75
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:21,740
deep learning is this dynamic field and as more tools are coming out,

76
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,180
you see researchers really push their limits and then ask for more and more.

77
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:26,370
Yeah.

78
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,950
I think that's a good way to approach designing a product with these users in mind.

79
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,280
Yeah.

80
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,790
So, I wanted to ask you too like removed a bit from your individual experience,

81
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,600
who were the first users of PyTorch and how did that

82
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,630
community inform how this framework evolved?

83
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:49,400
Yeah. So PyTorch had an interesting development experience.

84
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,240
We started with just the three of us,

85
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,780
and then we got other people interested within Facebook.

86
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,735
So, it was me, Adam Pashka,

87
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:04,275
who was an intern with me,

88
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:07,080
and Sam Gross, who's another engineer.

89
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,355
Were you still all working with Yann LeCun at this point?

90
00:05:10,355 --> 00:05:15,270
Yeah. So, we were working at Fair and Yann LeCun Rand Fair.

91
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,860
It was a fairly large organization by then,

92
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,255
like 70, 80 people.

93
00:05:19,255 --> 00:05:20,530
Fairly large fair.

94
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:28,880
Right. So, what happened was the three of us did a core iteration of the product,

95
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,935
saying this is how it should look.

96
00:05:30,935 --> 00:05:34,620
We based off of our designs of there was a package

97
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,745
called Torch auto grad and like the old lower Torch.

98
00:05:38,745 --> 00:05:45,805
Then there's a package called Chainer that's still around from engineers in Japan.

99
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:48,350
We thought those packages made sense,

100
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,270
but we also wanted the back-end of Torch,

101
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,500
which is really powerful.

102
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,790
So, combined all of that,

103
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,625
made something, and then we showed it to some people internally.

104
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,380
There's a bunch of friends internally who were

105
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,530
excited and wanted to contribute to the project.

106
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:10,730
Then about eight or nine people joined in part time just adding this feature,

107
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,365
doing things like that.

108
00:06:12,365 --> 00:06:15,845
Then slowly and steadily we started giving

109
00:06:15,845 --> 00:06:20,844
access to other people who I knew in the community,

110
00:06:20,844 --> 00:06:24,500
the non-existent community, but I knew they were

111
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,665
looking for a new tool and they would like it.

112
00:06:27,665 --> 00:06:34,330
So, I gave access to James Bradbury from Salesforce,

113
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,950
a bunch of people from the lower Torch community,

114
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:42,360
Andrej Karpathy and a few people here and there.

115
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,740
It would be like a review week,

116
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,375
we would give access to about 10 people.

117
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:47,885
Wow.

118
00:06:47,885 --> 00:06:51,575
Then they would give us feedback saying, "This is broken code."

119
00:06:51,575 --> 00:06:53,135
That's good feedback too.

120
00:06:53,135 --> 00:06:55,580
Yeah, so we created on that for like

121
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:01,890
about six months and then in Jan we released PyTorch to the public.

122
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,245
That's pretty much how it all started.

123
00:07:04,245 --> 00:07:06,345
The community grew.

124
00:07:06,345 --> 00:07:11,175
Again, power users were our initial crowd,

125
00:07:11,175 --> 00:07:13,410
and it grew from that.

126
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,965
It's like more completely through word of mouth.

127
00:07:16,965 --> 00:07:20,310
It grew where each person tells

128
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:25,430
their friend and they switch and then the whole research labs started Torching.

129
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,105
It is definitely not any of the production crowd or the enterprise people,

130
00:07:29,105 --> 00:07:32,810
it was more of the fun long tail of people.

131
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,665
Yeah, I like that.

132
00:07:34,665 --> 00:07:35,920
That's how it all started.
