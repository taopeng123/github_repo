00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
When we talk about spatial patterns in an image,

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,545
we're often talking about one of two things,

3
00:00:05,545 --> 00:00:08,945
color or shape, and I want to focus on shape for a moment.

4
00:00:08,945 --> 00:00:12,945
Shape can also be thought of as patterns of intensity in an image.

5
00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:16,635
Intensity is a measure of light and dark, similar to brightness,

6
00:00:16,635 --> 00:00:20,805
and we can often use this knowledge to detect the shape of objects in an image.

7
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:25,220
For example, say, you're trying to distinguish a person from a background in an image.

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,970
You can look at the contrast that occurs where the person ends and the background

9
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,820
begins to define a shape boundary that separates the two.

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,060
You can often identify the edges of an object by looking at abrupt changes in intensity,

11
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,590
which happen when an image changes from a very dark to light area.

12
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,130
In the next few videos,

13
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,400
you'll be using and creating specific image filters that look at

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,140
groups of pixels and detect big changes in intensity in an image.

15
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,070
These filters produce an output that shows various edges and shapes.

16
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,540
So, let's take a closer look at these filters and

17
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,310
see what role they play in a convolutional neural network.
