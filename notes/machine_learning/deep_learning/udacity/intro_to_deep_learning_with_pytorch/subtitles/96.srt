1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,150
Let's begin by investigating how deep learning can

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,120
be used to recognize a single object in an image.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,980
In this example, we want to design

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,620
an image classifier that takes in an image of a hand-written number,

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,165
and produces a predicted class for that number.

6
00:00:14,165 --> 00:00:17,780
This class ideally, correctly identifies the given image.

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,500
To build this, we'll use the MNIST database,

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,495
which contains thousands of small gray scale images of hand-written digits.

9
00:00:24,495 --> 00:00:27,835
Each image depicts one of the numbers zero through nine.

10
00:00:27,835 --> 00:00:29,460
This database is perhaps one of

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,140
the most famous databases in the field of machine and deep learning.

12
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,390
It was one of the first databases used to prove the usefulness of

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,670
neural networks and has continued to inform

14
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,360
the development of new architectures overtime.

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,060
If you look over this small sample of data,

16
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,940
you might notice that some digits are more legible than others.

17
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,040
For instance, if you squint just right,

18
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,890
this three could pass for an eight.

19
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,860
You can imagine that the dataset contains some fours that could pass for nines,

20
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,570
or ones and sevens.

21
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,249
Even with these subtleties,

22
00:00:58,249 --> 00:01:01,685
for us the task of identifying these numbers is pretty easy.

23
00:01:01,685 --> 00:01:04,895
We also want to design an appropriate model such that

24
00:01:04,895 --> 00:01:08,300
it too can accurately distinguish between each of these numbers.

25
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,530
Using deep learning, we can take a data-driven approach to training an algorithm

26
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,630
that can examine these images and discover

27
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,170
patterns that distinguish one number from another.

28
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,835
Our algorithm will need to attain some level of

29
00:01:19,835 --> 00:01:23,250
understanding of what makes a hand-drawn one look like a one,

30
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,790
and how images of ones differ from images of say twos or threes.

31
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,960
The first step in recognizing patterns in

32
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,990
images is learning how images are seen by computers.

33
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,630
So, before we start to design an algorithm,

34
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,760
let's first visualize this data and take a closer look at these images.
