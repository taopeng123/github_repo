1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
I'll be teaching this lesson in tandem with Alexis.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,120
And as she already mentioned this lesson is all about

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,700
convolutional neural networks and how they improve our ability to classify images.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,400
In general, CNNs can look at images as a whole and learn to

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,060
identify spatial patterns such as prominent colors and shapes,

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,405
or whether a texture is fuzzy or smooth and so on.

7
00:00:21,405 --> 00:00:24,240
The shapes and colors that define any image and

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,675
any object in an image are often called features.

9
00:00:27,675 --> 00:00:30,390
I'll cover how a CNN can learn to identify

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,380
these features and how a CNN can be used for image classification.

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,590
And Alexis will talk about the various layers that

12
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,345
make up a complete convolutional neural network.

13
00:00:39,345 --> 00:00:40,745
By the end of this lesson,

14
00:00:40,745 --> 00:00:42,800
you should have all the skills you need to

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,820
define and train an image classifier of your own.
