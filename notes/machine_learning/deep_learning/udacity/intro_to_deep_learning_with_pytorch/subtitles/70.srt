1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
So, when I think about Pitrad,

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,130
especially it'd been supportive by all these different cloud providers,

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,695
I think of it as being a separate entity from Facebook.

4
00:00:10,695 --> 00:00:14,745
Which I think it definitely has its own life and community,

5
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:22,010
but I'm wondering where it fits in the larger Facebook product or if it fits at all,

6
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,245
where might it be used in that product?

7
00:00:24,245 --> 00:00:28,970
So, Facebook has needs and the AI space.

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:34,090
They have Facebook AI Research and as fundamental research.

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,890
We do research in the open,

10
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,060
we use open datasets,

11
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,220
we build our research,

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,360
we publish it onto archive, to peer review.

13
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:52,655
We also have a huge set of needs for products at Facebook.

14
00:00:52,655 --> 00:00:56,545
Whether it's our camera enhancements,

15
00:00:56,545 --> 00:01:00,690
or whether it is our machine translation,

16
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:07,650
or whether it's our accessibility interfaces, or integrity filtering.

17
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:15,810
So, we need tools that can do all of these.

18
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:22,700
I think Facebook's investment is mostly on the perspective that if you need tools,

19
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,820
we are going to invest in tools anyways,

20
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,460
might as well make it an open-source investment.

21
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:38,140
Because Ferris mission is to do AI research in the open and advance humanity using AI.

22
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,670
So, this seems very,

23
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,800
very fitting with that mission as well.
