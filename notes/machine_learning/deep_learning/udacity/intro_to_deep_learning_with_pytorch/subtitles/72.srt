1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
And then my last question for you is if you have any advice for people

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,130
who are just sort of getting into the field of AI and deep learning,

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,480
and curious to learn more.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,115
If you have any recommendations for them.

5
00:00:11,115 --> 00:00:13,050
Sure. I would just say,

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,135
be hands-on from day one.

7
00:00:15,135 --> 00:00:19,200
I think I spent a long time trying

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,840
to collect all the material that is possibly available,

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:32,335
I think get a 100 textbooks because it seemed like if I just got the textbooks,

10
00:00:32,335 --> 00:00:36,275
I already got the knowledge in some fractional form.

11
00:00:36,275 --> 00:00:40,580
And then like also just do a lot of passive stuff,

12
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:48,360
like listening to an android lecture or reading some blog post,

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,920
and then be like, "Oh, oh, yeah.

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,030
Those types, those types."

15
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,305
Then there's always the barrier which is,

16
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:59,480
when you actually sat and try to do something, you'd just black out.

17
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,310
"I know all of this stuff.

18
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,170
I read all of it, why I can't apply it?"

19
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:10,970
I think that details as students are trying to get into the field of deep learning,

20
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:15,935
either to apply it to their own stuff or just to learn the concepts,

21
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:20,930
it's very important to make sure you do it from day one.

22
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:21,110
Yeah.

23
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:29,745
Stay on track. [inaudible] you encourage people to do projects,

24
00:01:29,745 --> 00:01:31,470
and review the projects,

25
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,540
and give people feedback.

26
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,020
I think that's a very very good interaction,

27
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,210
that's my only advice to people.

28
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,265
It's to make sure you do lesser,

29
00:01:41,265 --> 00:01:43,320
but do it hands-on,

30
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,230
rather than do a lot more,

31
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,925
but then just glance over it.

32
00:01:47,925 --> 00:01:50,870
Yeah. That's a sort of in-depth exploratory approach,

33
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,330
almost doing like a full circle back to just really

34
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,970
being consuming the information you need,

35
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:59,900
but then really being curious and exploratory on your own design.

36
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,105
Well, cool. Well, thank you so much for joining us.

37
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:05,210
And I'm excited to try out PyTorch [inaudible].

38
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,440
Absolutely. Thank you.
