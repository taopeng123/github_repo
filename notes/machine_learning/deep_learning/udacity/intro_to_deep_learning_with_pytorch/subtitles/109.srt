00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
A convolutional neural network is a special kind of

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,210
neural network in that it can remember spatial information.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,120
The neural networks that you've seen so far only look at individual inputs.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,750
But convolutional neural networks,

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,560
can look at an image as a whole,

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,820
or in patches and analyze groups of pixels at a time.

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,200
The key to preserving the spatial information

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,375
is something called the convolutional layer.

9
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,760
A convolutional layer applies a series of

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,155
different image filters also known as convolutional kernels to an input image.

11
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:30,975
The resulting filtered images have different appearances.

12
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:34,890
The filters may have extracted features like the edges of objects in that image,

13
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,920
or the colors that distinguish the different classes of images.

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,695
In the case of classifying digits for example,

15
00:00:40,695 --> 00:00:43,820
CNN should learn to identify spatial patterns like

16
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:48,095
the curves and lines that make up the number six as distinct from another digit.

17
00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:51,440
Later layers in a model will learn how to combine different color

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,845
and spatial features to produce an output like a class label.

19
00:00:54,845 --> 00:00:59,630
Before we get into defining and training a complete CNN in the next couple videos,

20
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,065
you'll learn a bit more about the filters that define a convolutional layer.

21
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:06,190
How they're defined, and how they can transform an input image?

22
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,860
This will be important foundational knowledge that will come up again as you get to

23
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,240
training as CNN and even visualizing the inner workings of a trained CNN.
