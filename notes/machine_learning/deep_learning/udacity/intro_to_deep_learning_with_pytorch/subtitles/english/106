1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,410
So far, you've learned a lot about approaching the task of image classification.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,710
In fact, now is a good time to review the pipeline we've developed for such a task.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,060
First, load and visualize the data you're working with,

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,170
then pre-process that data by normalizing it and converting it into a tensor,

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,070
so that it's prepped for further processing by the layers of a neural network.

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,805
Then, do your research,

7
00:00:21,805 --> 00:00:24,645
has anyone approached this or similar task before?

8
00:00:24,645 --> 00:00:28,020
What kind of deep learning models have already been tried and tested?

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,200
Use this research to help you decide on a model architecture and define it.

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,695
Then, decide on loss and optimization functions and proceed with training your model.

11
00:00:36,695 --> 00:00:39,465
Here, you may choose to use a validation dataset

12
00:00:39,465 --> 00:00:42,410
to select and save the best model during training.

13
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,930
Finally, test your model on previously unseen data.

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,025
At this point, feel free to take a break from what you are learning,

15
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:51,530
take time to absorb what you've learned so far.

16
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,765
Then when you're ready, you can keep going.

17
00:00:53,765 --> 00:00:57,560
Next, I'll go over a new kind of architecture for image classification,

18
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,290
a convolutional neural network,

19
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,640
which can help us build even better image classification models.
