00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,465
So, just a quick note about PyTorch.

2
00:00:03,465 --> 00:00:05,790
The features I'm demonstrating in this lesson,

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,760
are only available from PyTorch 1.0.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,785
At the time I am recording these videos,

5
00:00:11,785 --> 00:00:15,570
hydro 20.0 is not the stable version of PyTorch.

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,940
So, if you install PyTorch the normal way,

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,560
so you go to their website,

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,080
and you click on all these stuff, and you choose Stable,

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,560
you're actually going to get PyTorch version 0.4.

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,765
So, if you want to use these new features,

11
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:30,540
right now, you need to click on preview, over here.

12
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,525
Once you do that, you can choose your appropriate platform,

13
00:00:33,525 --> 00:00:34,890
how you want to install it,

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,035
and then you copy this command,

15
00:00:37,035 --> 00:00:38,535
and run it in your terminal.

16
00:00:38,535 --> 00:00:40,230
So, you have just to keep this in mind;

17
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,220
if you're trying to use these new features,

18
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,580
and for some reason they're not available,

19
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,700
be sure to check what version of PyTorch you're using.

20
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,890
So, you'll need to use at least,

21
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,870
PyTorch 1.0, to actually use these new scripting,

22
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,930
and tracing features. Cheers.
