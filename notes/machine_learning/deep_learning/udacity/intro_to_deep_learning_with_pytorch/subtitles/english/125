00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
You've seen that CNN's or some of

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,945
the most powerful networks for image classification and analysis.

3
00:00:05,945 --> 00:00:09,840
CNN's process visual information in a feed forward manner,

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,970
passing an input image through a collection of

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,655
image filters which extract certain features from the input image.

6
00:00:15,655 --> 00:00:18,555
It turns out that these feature level representations

7
00:00:18,555 --> 00:00:20,935
are not only useful for classification,

8
00:00:20,935 --> 00:00:23,120
but for image construction as well.

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,005
These representations are the basis for applications like Style Transfer and Deep Dream.

10
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:33,020
Which compose images based on CNN layer activations and extracted features.

11
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,310
In this lesson we'll focus on learning about

12
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,775
and implementing the style transfer algorithm.

13
00:00:37,775 --> 00:00:40,310
Style transfer allows you to apply the style of

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,850
one image to another image of your choice.

15
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,770
For example, here we've applied the style of Hokusai,

16
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,675
The Great Wave [inaudible] print to a picture of a cat.

17
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:50,480
The key to this technique is using

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,105
a trained CNN to separate the content from the style of an image.

19
00:00:54,105 --> 00:00:56,810
If you can do this then you can merge the content of

20
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,810
one image with the style of another and create something entirely different.

21
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,440
Next, we'll talk about how style and content

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,140
can be separated and by the end of this lesson,

23
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,640
you'll have all the knowledge you need to generate a stylized image of your own design.
