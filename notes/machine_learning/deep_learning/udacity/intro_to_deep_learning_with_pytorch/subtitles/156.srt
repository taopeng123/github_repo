1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
After encoding all our word and label data as an additional preprocessing step,

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,000
we want to make sure that our reviews are in good shape for standard processing.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,905
That is, our network will expect a standard input text size,

4
00:00:12,905 --> 00:00:16,885
and so we'll want to shape our reviews into a consistent specific length.

5
00:00:16,885 --> 00:00:20,160
There are two things we'll need to do to approach this task.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,805
First, I'm going to take a look at the review data and see do we have

7
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:28,440
any especially sure or longer views that might mess with our training process.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,630
I'll especially look to see if we have any reviews of length zero which

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,830
will not provide any text information and will just act as noisy data.

10
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,210
If I find any of those zero length reviews,

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,840
I'll want to remove them from our data entirely.

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,330
Then second, I'll look at the remaining reviews,

13
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,845
and for really long reviews,

14
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:48,710
I'll actually truncate them at a specific length.

15
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,560
I'll do something similar for shortest reviews and make sure

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,695
that I'm creating a set of reviews that are all the same length.

17
00:00:54,695 --> 00:00:57,440
This will be our padding and truncation step,

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,960
where we basically pad our data with columns of zeros

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,410
or remove columns until we get our desired input shape.

20
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,520
Okay. Before we pad our review text,

21
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,085
we should check for reviews of length zero.

22
00:01:08,085 --> 00:01:10,910
The way I'm gonna do this is to use a counter.

23
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,985
For each review length that's currently in our data,

24
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:16,640
whether that's a length of zero or thousands of words,

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,370
I'll look at how many reviews are of that length.

26
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,640
So this returns a dictionary of

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,935
review lengths and account for how many our reviews fall into those lengths.

28
00:01:25,935 --> 00:01:28,660
So, here I'm looking at how many of our reviews are

29
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,735
zero length and I'll also print out the longest review length just to see.

30
00:01:32,735 --> 00:01:34,265
So, when I run this cell,

31
00:01:34,265 --> 00:01:36,895
I can see that I have one review that is zero length

32
00:01:36,895 --> 00:01:40,365
and that my longest review has over 2,000 words in it.

33
00:01:40,365 --> 00:01:44,415
This zero length review is just going to add noise into our dataset.

34
00:01:44,415 --> 00:01:47,385
So next, your task will be to create a new list of

35
00:01:47,385 --> 00:01:50,200
reviews_ints and an array of encoded labels,

36
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,650
where any reviews of zero length will be removed from this data.

37
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,870
So, remove any zero length reviews from

38
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,935
reviews_ints and remove that corresponding label as well.

39
00:01:58,935 --> 00:02:01,330
In this particular case, after running this cell,

40
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,130
I expect to see that one of our reviews was removed.

41
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,350
Try to solve this task on your own, and next,

42
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,530
I'll present my solution and introduce you to your next exercise.
