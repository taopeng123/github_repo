Steps to start SAS:

1. Start "Oracle VM VirtualBox"

2. In VirtualBox, select "SAS University Edition vApp", and then select Machine > Start > Normal Start. It might take a few minutes for the virtual machine to start.

Note: When the virtual machine is running, the screen with the SAS logo is replaced with a black console screen (called the Welcome window). You can minimize this window, but do not close the Welcome window until you are ready to end your SAS session.

3. In a web browser on your local computer, enter http://localhost:10080

4. From the SAS University Edition: Information Center, click Start SAS Studio.

--
Steps to end SAS:

1. Close the browser.

2. Close the black window. Then a small window pops out: Close Virtual Machine, select "Power off the machine", click "OK"

3. Close the Virtual Box window.

A statement end in a semicolon.

Groups of SAS statements that define your data and create a SAS data set are called a DATA step; SAS statements that requst prefefined routines are called a PROC (short for PROCEDURE) step.
