Chase那人發給我的Data Science Resources中說: 

SQL
- Basic queries
- Aggregations
- Joins
- I suggest installing MySQL on your computer and playing with that; it's pretty easy to install and use

References:
There are many good tutorials on the web, e.g. http://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-
novice-survey/

Yicun面試Chase時被問到的SQL: 
SQL, given schema, segragation? normalization?
