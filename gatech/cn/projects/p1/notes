Where to submit?

Pizza: In Canvas, when I resubmitted it renamed the submission to "Project1-1.zip". Is there a way to delete previous submissions to get the correct file naming when resubmitting?

Debug:

Error:
RTNETLINK answers: File exists

Solution:
As noted by student suggestions try either sudo mn -c or double check your switch configuration.  In particular make sure you haven't assigned two links to the same port.

Defining Topologies:

Running sudo ./topology.sh using the original mntopo.py:
topology-May22-00:38

Running sudo ./topology.sh using the modified mntopo.py (added two hosts and two switches):
topology-May23-01:58

Running sudo ./topology.sh using the modified mntopo.py (bw = 50, delay = 10ms):
topology-May23-02:06

Network Simulation

3. Let's perform a casual experiment. Issue a 100 packet ping command from h1 to h2, and then a 100 packet ping command from h1 to h3. How do the reported statistics differ across the two different wireless links?

h1 ping h2 -c 100

10.0.0.2 ping statistics
100 packets transmitted, 93 received, 7% packet loss, time 99158ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 24.191/24.621/31.715/0.855 ms

h1 ping h3 -c 100

10.0.0.3 ping staatistics
100 packets transmitted, 87 received, 13% packet loss, time 99183ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 32.217/33.063/73.688/4.398 ms
