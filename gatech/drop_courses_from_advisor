If a student withdraws from a course (or courses) and receives a “W” on his/her
transcript, this counts as a record of enrollment for that specific term

If you withdraw from school in the Fall 2018 semester, you still can register
for a Spring 2019 course.

Our records indicate that you did this for Summer 2018 and received time ticket
for Fall 2018, don't understand why you would have this question since you've
gone through this process recently!

Dear advisors:

I am considering withdrawing the only one course I am now taking(CS 7646) due to not having enough time. Since I got a D in the only one course I took in 2018 Spring, and withdrew the only one course I took in 2018 Summer, if I withdraw the only one course I am taking now in 2018 Fall, would I be dismissed from the program?

Thank you very much!
Tao Peng (GTID#: 903204171)
