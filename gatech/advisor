Dear OMSCS Students,

We hope you are having a great summer!

Please note that effective immediately, Sarah Farrar is on maternity leave.  Therefore, any OMSCS student whose last name begins with N through Sn should send his/her inquiries to oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu, and another advisor will respond.

As always, please be sure to include your full name and nine-digit GT ID number (90X-XX-XXXX).

We ask that you bear with us during this transitional period, and please remember to allow a little extra response time for an advisor to respond to your request.

We will notify everyone once Sarah returns from her leave.  Thank you for your patience in the meantime.

Sincerely,

OMSCS Advising Team
