1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,690
And that's just the beginning of what you can

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:04,580
do with MapReduce. Recommendation systems,

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,260
fraud detection, item classification are

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,020
all great problems for MapReduce. These all have some

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,480
basic characteristics in common. They have a lot of data,

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,840
and the work can be parallelized rather than slogging

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,990
through in serial. Perhaps one of the more difficult things

8
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,310
to learn when you're new to Hadoop. Is how to

9
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,620
think about solving problems in terms of MapReduce. It can

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,580
be very different than how you're used to working. And

11
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,220
frankly, it takes a lot of practice. So in the next

12
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,840
lesson, we're going to write the code for the sales by

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,490
store problem, and we'll also start talking about other MapReduce problems.
