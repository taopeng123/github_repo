1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,500
For a long time, the Name Node was a single point

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,790
of failure in Hadoop. If it died, the entire cluster was

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,970
inaccessible. If the meta data on the Name Node was lost

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,930
completely, the entire cluster's data was lost. Sure, you've still got

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,700
all the blocks on the data nodes but you've no way

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,680
of knowing which block belongs to which file whithout the meta

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,430
data. So, to avoid the problem, people would configure the Name

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,940
Node to store meta data, not only on it's own hard drive

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,150
but also somewhere on a network file system. NFS

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,070
is a method of mounting a remote disk. That way,

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,890
even if the Name Node bursts into flames, there

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,230
would be a copy of the metadata elsewhere on the

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,772
network. These days, there's an even better alternative. The

14
00:00:40,772 --> 00:00:42,716
Name Node is not a single point of failure in

15
00:00:42,716 --> 00:00:46,160
most production clusters, because they've configured two Name Nodes.

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,390
The active Name Node works as before, but the standby

17
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,800
can be configured to take over if the active one

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,020
fails. That way the cluster will keep running if any of

19
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,590
the nodes, even one of the Name Nodes, fails. Ian's

20
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,480
now going to show us a demonstration of how to use HDFS.
