00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,310
That Hadoop job command we typed was pretty painful to have to remember.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,540
So to save you time, we've created an alias in the demo virtual

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:12,910
machine that you'll be downloading. You can just type hs followed by four

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,670
arguments, the mapper script, the reducer script,

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,950
the input directory, and the output directory.

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,910
Here's one important thing to note, though. When

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,640
you're running a Hadoop job, the output directory must

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,820
not already exist. And as you can see, if we try and run the command with an

9
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,920
existing directory. In this case, job output. Hadoop

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,550
refuses to run the job. This is actually a

11
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,550
feature of Hadoop. It's designed to stop you inadvertently

12
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,890
deleting or overwriting data that's already in the cluster.

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,020
But as you can see, if we specify a different directory,

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,890
which doesn't already exist, then the job will begin just fine.
