1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,920
So when we have multiple reducers, say these

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,380
two, and the mapper might output keys apple,

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,850
banana, carrot and grape. Which keys, will go

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,380
to the first reducer? Here are some options. Maybe

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,840
apple and banana go to the first reducer,

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,870
or apple and carrot, carrot and grape. Or

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,890
apple and grape, or, we don't know specifically,

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,450
but they'll be split evenly with each reducer getting

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,510
two of the keys. Or we don't know, and it's

10
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,730
possible that one reducer could get none of the keys.
