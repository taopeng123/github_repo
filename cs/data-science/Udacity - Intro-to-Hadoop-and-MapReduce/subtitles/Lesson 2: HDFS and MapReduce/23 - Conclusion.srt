1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,010
So that's the end of the lesson. You learned how Hadoop

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:07,020
uses HDFS to store data and MapReduce to process it. In the

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,380
next lesson we'll walk through the code for a MapReduce program, and

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,530
you'll be ready to write your own MapReduce programs to analyze data.
