1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,710
It definitely is a problem if there's a network failure

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:05,560
between the nodes and they can't talk to one another.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,640
It's also a problem if we had a disk failure,

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,830
on an individual data node. It's not a problem that some

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,010
nodes are unused, they'll be used by data later. It's

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,890
also not a problem that some of the block sizes

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,780
are different. It is a problem if we were to

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,450
lose the disk on the name node and lose our metadata.
