00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,780
We've provided a virtual machine, with CDH, that's Clouderas

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,240
Distribution for Hadoop, pre-installed. We say that Hadoop is

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,360
running in pseudo-distributed mode, that means it's a full

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,680
cluster just running on one machine. It also includes sample

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,570
data sets and sample solutions the problems we ask

6
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,750
you to solve. Now would be a great time to

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,680
see the instructor notes on how to download the

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,260
virtual machine. You'll open it up, start the VM, and

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,210
then follow the step by step instructions, which show you how

10
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,680
to upload a file to HDFS and run a MapReduce job.
