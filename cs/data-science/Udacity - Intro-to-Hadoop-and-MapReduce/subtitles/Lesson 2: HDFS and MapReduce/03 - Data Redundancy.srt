00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,160
The problem with things right now, is that if one

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,110
of our nodes fails, we're left with missing data for the

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,450
file. If the node goes away for example, we've got

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,170
a 64 megabyte hole in the middle of my data.txt, and

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,610
of course similar problems with any other files that happen

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,370
to be stored on that node. To solve this problem, Hadoop

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:22,180
replicates each block three times, as it's stored in HDFS.

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,200
So block one doesn't just live here, it may also be

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,410
here and here. Block two is here, here and here,

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,930
and block three is here, here, and here. Hadoop just

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,600
picks three nodes at random and puts one copy of

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,390
the block on each of the three. Well actually, it's not

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,400
totally random, but that's close enough for us right now.

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,260
So now if a single node fails, it's not a problem

15
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,200
because we have two other copies of the block on

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,390
other nodes. And the NameNode is smart enough to see that

17
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,180
these blocks are now under-replicated and it will arrange

18
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,350
to have those block re-replicated on the cluster. So we're

19
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,980
back to having three copies of them. So we've taken

20
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,210
care of the problem, if one of our data node

21
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:05,129
fails. But there's another obvious single point of failure here.

22
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,340
What happens if the NameNode has a hardware problem? Might

23
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,407
the data be inaccessible? Or is the data in HDFS

24
00:01:12,407 --> 00:01:15,840
lost forever? Or is everything fine and there's no problem?
