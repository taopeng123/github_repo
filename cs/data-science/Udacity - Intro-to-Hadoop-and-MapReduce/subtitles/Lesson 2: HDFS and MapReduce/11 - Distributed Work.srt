1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,820
Rather than one person reading the entire ledger, say we

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,510
had more people to help, like the staff of your accounting

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,240
department. We'll split them into two groups, called the mappers and

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,620
the reducers. Then we'll take the ledger, break it into chunks,

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,370
give each chunk to one of the mappers. That way all

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,930
the mappers can work at the same time, each over a

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,630
small fraction of the data. Let's see what a mapper would

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,650
do. They will take the first record in their ledger, and

9
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,870
on an index card write the name of the store,

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,870
and the amount of a sale. Then they'll take the

11
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,500
next record, and repeat. As they're writing the index cards

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,730
they'll pile them up so that cards for the same

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,130
store go in the same pile. By the end, each

14
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,330
mapper will have a pile of card per store. Once

15
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,850
the mappers have finished, the reducers can collect their sets

16
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,100
of cards. We'll tell each reducer which store they're responsible for.

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,510
Such as this one for New York City, and this

18
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,560
one for Miami and Los Angeles. The reducers go to the

19
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,410
mappers and retrieve the pile of cards for their stores.

20
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,010
It's fast for them to do because the mappers have already

21
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,060
separated the cards into a pile per store. Once the

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,190
reducers have retrieved all their data, they collect all the small

23
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,590
piles and create a larger pile. Then they start going through

24
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,250
the piles one at a time. All they have to do

25
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,700
at this point is add up all the amounts from all the cards in

26
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,200
the pile. That gives them a total sales for that store. They can then write

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,620
that amount on their final sheet. To

28
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,310
keep things organized each reducer goes through his

29
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,440
or her set of piles in alphabetical

30
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,600
order. In other words, Los Angeles before Miami.
