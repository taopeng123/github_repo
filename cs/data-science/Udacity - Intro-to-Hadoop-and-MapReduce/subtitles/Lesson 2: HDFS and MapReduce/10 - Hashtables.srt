00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,830
Since we have millions and millions of sales to process, it's

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,570
going to take a very long time for our computer to

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,670
first have to read the data off-disk and then process it

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,680
line by line. Also, the more stores we have, the longer

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,760
it takes to check if we've seen that store, add it

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,200
to the hash table, and add the running value to the

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,870
total. We may even run out of memory holding the hash

8
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:25,280
table. However, it probably would work. And you would get the

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,310
right result eventually. Let's see how we could

10
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,870
do this more efficiently with a MapReduce job
