It depends on the kind of failure. If there's a

00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,080
network failure to the name node, then the data would be

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,942
temporarily inaccessible. If the disk on the single name node

00:00:10,942 --> 00:00:14,590
were to fail, the data in HDFS could be lost forever.
