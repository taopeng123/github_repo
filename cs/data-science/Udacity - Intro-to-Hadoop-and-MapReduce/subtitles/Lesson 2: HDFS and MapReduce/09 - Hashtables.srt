00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,969
Historically, we'd probably use an associative array or a hash table

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:07,320
to solve this problem in a traditional computing environment. The location

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,080
would be the key and the sales for that store, the

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,770
value. Then we'd process the input file one line at a

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,990
time, adding each store as a key. What problems do you

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,000
see with this approach? Say if you were running it on

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,620
one terabyte of data. Do you think that it flat out

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,470
won't work? Or could you run out of memory having to store

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,050
this hash table. Could it take an excessively long

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,450
time? Or will we not get the right answer?
