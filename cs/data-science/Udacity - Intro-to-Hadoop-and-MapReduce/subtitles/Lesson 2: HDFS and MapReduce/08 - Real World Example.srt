00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,510
Let's imagine we run a retailer with thousands of stores around

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,730
the world. And we have a big ledger that contains all

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,000
of our sales, the big book of sales for the year

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,110
2012. We've been asked to calculate things like the total sales per

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,500
store for the year. Let's say the lines of the ledger

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,460
look like this. The date of the purchase, the location of the

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,990
store, what they bought, and the amount. One way we could

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,670
do this is just start at the beginning of the ledger and

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,100
for every entry we see, write down the store

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,720
location and the amount. Then keep going. For the fourth

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,830
entry, we see that we've already written down Miami. So

12
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:40,119
we'll update the amount to 62.15, and we would continue.
