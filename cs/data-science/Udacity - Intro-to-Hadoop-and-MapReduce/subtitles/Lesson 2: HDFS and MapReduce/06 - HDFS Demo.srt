00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,380
So, here I have a directory on my local machine,

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,430
which contains a couple of files, and I want to

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,310
put one of them into hdfs. All of the commands

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,480
which interact with the Hadoop file system start with Hadoop

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,490
FS. So first of all, let's see what we have

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,300
in hdfs to start with. I do that by saying

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,590
hadoop fs minus ls. That gives me a listing of

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,890
what's in my home directory on the Hadoop cluster. Because

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,490
I'm logged in to the local machine as a user called training, my home directory

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,850
in hdfs is /user/training. And as you can see, there's nothing there. So

11
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:40,080
now, let's upload our purchases.txt file. We do that

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,482
with hadoop fs minus put purchases.txt. Hadoop fs minus put

13
00:00:45,482 --> 00:00:51,050
takes a local file and places it into hdfs. Since I'm not specifying

14
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,905
a destination filename, it'll be uploaded with the same

15
00:00:53,905 --> 00:00:57,190
filename. So, it takes a few seconds to upload. And

16
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:01,010
now I can do another hadoop fs minus ls, and

17
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,060
we can see that that file is now in hdfs.

18
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,400
I can take a look at the last few

19
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,740
lines of the file by saying, hadoop fs minus tail,

20
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,330
and then the filename, and that just displays the last

21
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,210
few lines on the screen for me. There's also a

22
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,210
hadoop fs minus cat, which will display the

23
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,070
entire contents of the file and we'll use that

24
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,510
later. There are plenty of other hadoop fs commands

25
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,570
and as you'll probably have started to realize, they

26
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,980
closely mirror standard UNIX file system commands. So, if I want to rename the

27
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:36,167
file, for example, I can say hadoop fs minus mv, which moves

28
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:41,572
purchases.txt, in this case, to newname.txt. If I want

29
00:01:41,572 --> 00:01:47,265
to delete a file, hadoop fs minus rm will remove that file for me. So,

30
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:52,621
let's get rid of newname.txt from hdfs. I create a directory in hdfs by

31
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:55,163
saying hadoop fs minus mkdir and then

32
00:01:55,163 --> 00:01:59,263
the directory name, and now let's upload purchases.txt

33
00:01:59,263 --> 00:02:04,839
and place it in the myinput directory so that it's ready for processing by hdfs.

34
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:12,360
Once I've done that, hadoop fs minus ls myinput will show me

35
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,850
the contents of that directory. And just as I expected, there's the file.
