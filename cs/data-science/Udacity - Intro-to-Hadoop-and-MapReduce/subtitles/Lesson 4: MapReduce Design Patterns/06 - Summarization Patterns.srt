00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,536
The next design patterns we're going to discuss, are

2
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:06,630
summarization patterns. And, these are patterns that give you, some

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,145
quick easy high level understanding of your data. And we're

4
00:00:10,145 --> 00:00:12,530
going to make a distinction here. We're going to talk about making

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,050
what's called an inverted index. And this is very similar

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,760
to the index you'd find in a back of a

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,840
book, or the indexing that Google does when it crawls

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,990
the web. And, we're also going to talk about numerical summarizations.

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:32,600
And, these are things like finding counts, how many of a certain record type, or

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,980
min and max. And min and max of course, can be used to calculate first

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,140
or last. Or calculate statistics like, mean

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,600
and median, and basically any other high level

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,660
numerical value that you can use to summarize

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,084
your data set. In this section of summarization

15
00:00:52,084 --> 00:00:54,493
patterns, we'll also talk about some

16
00:00:54,493 --> 00:00:58,727
interesting additional [INAUDIBLE] functionality, something that

17
00:00:58,727 --> 00:01:01,574
can exist between [INAUDIBLE] reducers, known

18
00:01:01,574 --> 00:01:03,330
as combiners. So, let's keep going.
