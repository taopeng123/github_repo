1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,990
So we've talked about a few design patterns

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:07,760
with MapReduce. We've talked about filtering patterns, summarizing

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,580
patterns, and structural patterns, but what good are

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,040
they? Well, these patterns, can be thought of as

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,130
sort of lenses. To try and view your

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,130
problems through. If you have a big data problem

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,960
and you're trying to do some analysis, that

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,660
at its heart is really about filtering, about selecting

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:31,670
from a large data set and getting some smaller sample of that data set. There's

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,820
a good chance that you can use this

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,800
filtering pattern. Likewise, if the fundamental nature of

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,250
your, of your problem is summarizing or

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,630
going from a structured to hierarchical sort of

14
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,220
database. In fact, these aren't all the patterns

15
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:51,020
you might want to use. There's also organizational patterns.

16
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,930
There's patterns that deal with input and output and

17
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,960
there's others. But getting yourself to ask this question, can,

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,600
you just have to say. Is this problem I'm dealing

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,170
with filtering, or summarizing, or structural, or something else? That

20
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,256
isn't simple. In fact, just identifying when map reduce

21
00:01:07,256 --> 00:01:09,830
is the appropriate tool for a problem is a large

22
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,444
part of what it means to be a MapReduce expert.

23
00:01:12,444 --> 00:01:16,240
And getting this expertise takes practice. This practice can come

24
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,787
naturally in the job environment. Or you could

25
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,295
choose to make it happen deliberately by seeking out

26
00:01:21,295 --> 00:01:23,454
problems and trying to solve them. But, if

27
00:01:23,454 --> 00:01:26,626
you enjoy learning about and thinking about these patterns,

28
00:01:26,626 --> 00:01:29,249
you should check that book, I mentioned earlier,

29
00:01:29,249 --> 00:01:32,770
Mapreduce Design Patterns and you can learn more there.

30
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,870
But now, it's time to try implementing some

31
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,264
of these patterns in, in sort of novel fitting.
