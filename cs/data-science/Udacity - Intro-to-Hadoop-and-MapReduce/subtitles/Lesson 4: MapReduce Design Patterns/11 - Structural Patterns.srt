1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,020
Finally, we're going to talk about structural patterns.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,870
And this is a very pragmatic pattern to discuss

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,440
honestly because it's a pattern you use if you're

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,630
ever migrating data, from relational data base management systems,

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,030
to a Hadoop system. And what you do

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,370
with this pattern, is taking advantage of the fact

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,040
that Hadoop, doesn't care what format your data is

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,120
in, which means you can take advantage of hierarchical

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,540
data, which will allow you to avoid doing

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,670
live joins and several data sets at the time

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,920
of analysis. So if you know a kind of

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,100
information you're going to want to get later you can

13
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:39,330
save a lot of time by reformatting your data. Now in order to

14
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:44,212
use this pattern, your data sources must be linked by some

15
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:50,490
foreign keys, and the data must be structured and row based,

16
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,020
and in fact this pattern in the book of [INAUDIBLE]

17
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,490
design pattern is actually they refer to as structured hierarchical pattern.
