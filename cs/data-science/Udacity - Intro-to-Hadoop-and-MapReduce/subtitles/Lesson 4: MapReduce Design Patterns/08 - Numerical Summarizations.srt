1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,380
Now let's move on to numerical summarizations. These are some of

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,600
my favorite. These are the summarizations you're going to want to use when your

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,455
boss says, "show me the numbers". These are the numbers you're

4
00:00:09,455 --> 00:00:11,840
going to want to show your boss. And,

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,880
what kind of numerical summarizations? Well,

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,300
we've talked about it a bit already. We might want to do

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,080
a word or record count. And for a word or record count,

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,850
which is something you've already done with the web server log

9
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,220
files, the [UNKNOWN] just outputs the thing you're interested as the key,

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:32,960
and outputs one for the value. The reducer then chugs along, sums up the values,

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,070
bada bing, bada boom, problem solved. This is like the Hello World of map

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,550
produce. Slightly more difficult are things like

13
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,670
calculating the mean or the median, or

14
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,380
if we really want to get really fancy, the standard deviation of a set of data.
