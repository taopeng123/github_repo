00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,540
So, in this lesson, what patterns are we going to learn? Well, we'll learn about

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,470
filtering patterns, we'll learn about summarization patterns,

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,560
and something we'll call structural patterns. And

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,238
these are all just frameworks for using

5
00:00:15,238 --> 00:00:17,730
MapReduce for solve problems that you've probably

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,800
encountered as a programmer before. Filtering patterns

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,460
solve filtering problems. Like, sampling data, or,

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:30,760
maybe even generating some top-n list. Maybe,

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,787
top ten something. Summarization patterns solve summarization problems. Getting

10
00:00:35,787 --> 00:00:41,230
a high-level view of your data. Things like counting records. Finding

11
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,960
min and max, then calculating basic statistical values, like

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,580
mean, median, and mode. We can also use these patterns to create

13
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,780
an index, finally, these structural patterns will solves structural

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,110
problems. And, the one more focus on, in this

15
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,460
lesson, is combining two data sets. And, just to

16
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,150
warn you, this lesson will go fast, and, that

17
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,030
means you probably won't remember everything about all of

18
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,820
these patterns. Totally okay, not expected. The point of

19
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,820
this lesson, is for you to know that these

20
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,810
patterns exist. And that if you ever find yourself

21
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,470
in a situation with big data where you say this problem is really just a

22
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,130
filtering or a summarization problem. You'll know where

23
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,710
to look, to find a technique to solve.
