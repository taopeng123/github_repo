Hi, my name is Andy and I'm a instructor

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,861
at Udacity. I worked with Sara and Ian and

3
00:00:06,861 --> 00:00:10,790
Ngundega to help prepare this lesson and today I'm

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,390
going to deliver it for you. So, let's get

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,668
started. Up to this point you've familiarized yourself with

6
00:00:16,668 --> 00:00:19,450
MapReduce, you've written some mapper code, some reducer code.

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,960
And you probably have a decent understanding of what's

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,820
going on behind the scenes. But you might not

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,590
yet know when to use MapReduce to solve a

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,590
problem. And that's what we're going to try and get at

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,040
in this lesson. We're going to give you a bunch of

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,280
problems to solve and actually, each of these problems has

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,170
been deliberately selected, because each of these problems actually

14
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,970
represents some larger class of problems. In reality, the problems

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,690
you're likely to run into on the job are going

16
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,820
to fall into one of these certain classes of problems,

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,030
which is very convenient because it means you

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,560
can apply a sort of boiler plate solution, with

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,720
some modifications. These boilerplate solutions we call design patterns,

20
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,260
and they're really helpful. In this lesson we'll learn

21
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,350
about some of these design patterns, and we'll

22
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:12,070
practice using them on various problems. We're not going to

23
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,300
get into the details of where the patterns came

24
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,000
from, or why they look the way they do,

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,830
but, at the very least, at the end of this

26
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,360
lesson, you will have, well for one, you'll practice using these

27
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,090
patterns and you also have a resource. That you can always

28
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,460
come back to whenever you run into a problem that can

29
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,380
be solved using one of these patterns. If this kind of

30
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,980
stuff is really interesting to you, you should definitely check out

31
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,500
a book called MapReduce Design Patterns. It's written by Donald Miner

32
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,680
and Adam Shook and it's really interesting. Anyways, let's get started.
