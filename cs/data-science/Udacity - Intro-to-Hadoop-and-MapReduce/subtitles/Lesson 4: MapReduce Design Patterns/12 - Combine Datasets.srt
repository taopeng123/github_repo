00:00:00,208 --> 00:00:03,220
So we going to use this structural to higher our

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,350
pattern, to combine two data sets and these data sets

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,310
are going to come from forms and what we're

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:13,670
going to want to do, is understand what the reputation

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,350
or the karma of the author of a post is and to do this we're going to have to

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,360
combine two tables. A post table and a user

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,540
table. Sorry. And a post contains data about each post.

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,670
Some ID, the title of the post, any

9
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:33,300
tags this author ID, which is going to be interesting

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,040
and then the body of the post, and some

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,780
other things. The user table. This is the user

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,100
pointer ID. And that is the common key

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,290
we're going to use to combine these two data sets.

14
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,860
It also has some other information like reputation, which

15
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,630
is going to help us answer this question and

16
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:56,380
gold, silver and bronze badges. So, go ahead

17
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,570
and see if you can answer this question.
