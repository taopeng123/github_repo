1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,960
So let's do it. Let's calculate mean

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,320
and standard deviation. And to do that, let's

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,430
think back to our example with stores and

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,486
sales. And let's say the question we want to

5
00:00:11,486 --> 00:00:15,430
answer is, is there any correlation between the

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,410
day of the week and how much money

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,408
people spend on various items? And what's interesting

8
00:00:22,408 --> 00:00:25,400
about this design pattern is that all the

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:31,208
mapper has to do is, I'll put the day of the week as a key, so maybe Monday, and

10
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:35,060
the value of a sale, maybe $5.20 as a value.

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,500
That's it. What does that leave for the reducer? Well,

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,570
it leaves all the math for the reducer. And the

13
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,850
general reason for this rule of thumb, for what the

14
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,990
mapper and reducer are doing, comes from the fact that

15
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,540
oftentimes with these, with these summary statistics, you sort of need

16
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,180
to know all of the statistics or all of

17
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,110
the parent data before you can make any calculations. So

18
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,230
we don't want to jump the gun and have the mapper

19
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,030
do calculations before it's ready. So why don't you go

20
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,310
ahead and calculate the mean and standard deviation for

21
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,050
sales for each day of the week, to help us

22
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,590
try to answer this question. If there's any correlation between

23
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,780
the day of the week and how much people spend.
