00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,180
When you read or talk about big data, you often

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:06,480
hear people say the three Vs. Volume refers to the size

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,880
of the data you're dealing with. Variety refers to the

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,100
fact that the data is often coming from a lot of

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,960
different sources and different formats. And velocity refers to the

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,990
speed at which it's being generated, and the speed at which

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,000
it needs to be made available for processing. So let's look

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,020
in more detail at each of these. Let's start with volume.

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,090
The price to store data has dropped incredibly

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,560
over the last 60 years. In 1980, the cost

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,048
per gigabyte was several hundred thousand dollars. In

12
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:38,660
2013, it's merely $0.10. Although it's worth saying, to

13
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,970
actually store the data reliably. You're going to

14
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,600
end up paying more than that. That's particularly the

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,170
case with more traditional storage devices such as storage

16
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,380
area networks, or SANS, which can be extremely expensive.

17
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,190
The high cost of reliable storage puts a cap on

18
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,650
the amount of data companies can practically store. At some

19
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,120
point they say, okay, it's too expensive to store all

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,080
that data. And I'm not doing anything with it. Let's just

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,090
store the critical stuff, like my actual sales. But it

22
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,150
turns out, as you'll see, that the data you're currently

23
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,110
throwing away can be incredibly useful. What we need is

24
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,470
a cheaper way to store it reliably. And of course storing

25
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,200
the data is only part of the equation. You also need to be able

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,640
read and process it efficiently. Storing a terabyte of data on a SAN, is

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,080
not that hard. But streaming the data from the SAN across the network to

28
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,734
say, some central processor, can take a

29
00:01:31,734 --> 00:01:34,210
long time and processing can be extremely slow.
