A potential challenge with big data is that it is

2
00:00:03,326 --> 00:00:07,680
created very fast. And does come from different sources, which could

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,410
be in a variety of formats. In my experience, most data

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,110
is not worthless. But actually does have a lot of value.
