But not everything is a big data problem. There are lots of cases where you can use a traditional system to store, manage and process your data. So the first thing you need to decide, is do you really have big data? To make that call, we need some sort of definition of what big data means.  Which of these would you consider to be big data? You won't be graded on this. Just give it your best guess. Would you consider the order details for purchases at a single store to be big data. Or all orders across hundreds of stores nationwide. Say, an individual's stock portfolio. Or all stock transactions for the New York Stock Exchange for a year.
