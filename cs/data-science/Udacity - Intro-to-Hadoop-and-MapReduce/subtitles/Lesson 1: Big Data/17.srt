00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,210
So there are plenty of things we can do with big

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,630
data, but first we need to be able to store the data

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,240
in a cost effective way, and then process it efficiently. And it

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,640
turns out, that's not easy to do, when we're talking about massive

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,240
amounts of data. Luckily, some smart people at Google were working on

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,930
this in the late 90s. They published some research papers, in 2003

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,570
and 2004. To learn more about that, let's talk to Doug Cutting,

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,390
one of the founders of Hadoop, and the Chief Architect at Cloudera.
