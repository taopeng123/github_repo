00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,230
But not everything is a big data problem. There are lots

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,990
of cases where you can use a traditional system to store, manage

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,380
and process your data. So the first thing you need to

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,810
decide, is do you really have big data? To make that call,

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,239
we need some sort of definition of what big data means.

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,040
Which of these would you consider to be big data? You won't

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,820
be graded on this. Just give it your best guess. Would

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,550
you consider the order details for purchases at a single store to

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,680
be big data. Or all orders across

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,370
hundreds of stores nationwide. Say, an individual's

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,420
stock portfolio. Or all stock transactions for

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,290
the New York Stock Exchange for a year.
