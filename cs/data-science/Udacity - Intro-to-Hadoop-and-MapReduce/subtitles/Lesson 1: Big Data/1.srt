00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,410
Hi, welcome to the introduction to Hadoop

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,220
and MapReduce. I'm Sarah Sproehnle. I'm the vice

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,029
president of educational services at Cloudera, the company

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,340
that helps develop, support, and manage Apache Hadoop.

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:15,200
>> And I'm Ian Wrigley, I'm Cloudera's senior curriculum manager. Between us,

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,650
Sarah and I have been responsible for bringing Hadoop training to well

7
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,310
over 20,000 people. And we're excited to bring it to a much

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,150
larger audience with Udacity. So during

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,530
this course, we're going to talk about what

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,230
Big Data is? What Hadoop is? Why Hadoop's useful? And

11
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,390
we're going to teach you how to write map reduce code.

12
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,110
>> In fact, by the end of the

13
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,280
course, you'll write a MapReduce program that efficiently processes

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,120
a very large web server log. And by

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,090
the end of lesson two, you'll already be running

16
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,810
a MapReduce job in Apache Hadoop. So let's

17
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,800
start. In this lesson we'll talk about what is

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,558
Big Data. We'll talk about the problems that it

19
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:51,310
creates, and then how Apache Hadoop addresses those problems.
