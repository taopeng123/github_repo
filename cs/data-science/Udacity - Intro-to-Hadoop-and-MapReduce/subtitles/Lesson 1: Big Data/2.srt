1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,047
Organisations have been generating
data since way back

2
00:00:03,248 --> 00:00:06,352
But as time goes on, more & more 
data is being generated.

3
00:00:06,705 --> 00:00:11,617
IBM estimates that 90% of world's data
was created in the last two years alone.

4
00:00:11,869 --> 00:00:14,465
This is a simple example.
Think of your cellphone.

5
00:00:14,578 --> 00:00:17,847
Whenever your cellphone is turned on,
it's connected to the cell towers.

6
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:20,034
As you move around,
it'll connect to different towers

7
00:00:20,132 --> 00:00:21,522
in a different signal streaks.

8
00:00:21,743 --> 00:00:25,556
All of that connection data is collected
by the phone company & it's being logged.

9
00:00:25,845 --> 00:00:28,495
They can use that information to find 
dead spots in the coverage

10
00:00:28,683 --> 00:00:31,808
& know which towers are busiest & 
need increased capacity.

11
00:00:31,928 --> 00:00:35,112
They can even trace you if you make an
emergency phone call but

12
00:00:35,112 --> 00:00:36,944
don't get your exact location.

13
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,573
This is an enormous amount 
of data we have.

14
00:00:39,824 --> 00:00:42,641
Another example as when you visit a 
website like Amazon or Netflix,

15
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:48,260
everything, you do there is logged: what
pages you view, how long you spend there,

16
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:50,181
where you coming from.

17
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:53,287
They can even capture things like what 
browser you are using.

18
00:00:53,472 --> 00:00:55,344
Again this is a huge amount of data.

19
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,656
Phone data & website logs are just examples.

20
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:02,556
In addition, things like X-rays are 
creating huge amounts of data.

21
00:01:02,615 --> 00:01:05,836
& people doing research to detect 
similarities in tumors.

22
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:09,691
The increase in amount of data we're 
generating opens up huge possibilities.

23
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:11,638
But it comes with problems too.

24
00:01:11,886 --> 00:01:15,410
Where do we've to store all this data?
& process it too?
