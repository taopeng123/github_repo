1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,440
So the name Hadoop comes from my son's toy

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,880
elephant. When he was about two, a friend gave

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,560
him a little stuffed elephant which he played with

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,030
incessantly. and we overheard him calling it something, this

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,110
strange word that he invented. and said Hadoop. So

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,420
I, I immediately wrote it down because I was

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,590
in the, the software business. And we're always looking

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,900
for good names. And this one came with a, a

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,840
mascot, even. and a few years later when I

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,542
needed a project name, pulled it out. Now I,

11
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:35,413
I wrote it down as H A D O O P. And figured that everyone would say Hadoop. Now

12
00:00:35,413 --> 00:00:39,949
it turns out everyone says Hadoop instead, but I persist in saying

13
00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:45,560
Hadoop. Now my son, of course, is 13, and expects

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,720
royalties for the name. He he wants more credit. He also accuses me of stealing

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,810
the toy. At some point, he was using it in some kind of rocket ship experiment,

16
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:01,100
and I had to rescue it. And now it, it lives in my sock drawer for, for safety.
