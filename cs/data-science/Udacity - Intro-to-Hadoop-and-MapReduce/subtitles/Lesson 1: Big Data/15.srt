1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,590
Velocity, the third v, is about the speed at which the data

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,900
arrives, ready to be processed. We need to be able to accept

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,410
and store that data, even when it's coming in at a rate

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,880
of terabytes per day. If we can't store it as it arrives,

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,481
we'll end up discarding some of it, and that's what we want

6
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:18,921
to avoid. Think about an ecommerce website. If we knew what products

7
00:00:18,921 --> 00:00:22,053
you've looked at in the past, we can recommend similar products the

8
00:00:22,053 --> 00:00:25,540
next time you visit our site. If you've had spent five minutes

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,040
looking at a particular item, we could maybe send you

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,680
an email informing you the product is on sale. If

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,412
we know that you typically browse our site using a

12
00:00:33,412 --> 00:00:37,470
first generation iPad, we could suggest the latest model. This is

13
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,090
a huge difference to what we could do before, when

14
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,240
we only stored the records of the actual purchases. If we

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,370
can store and process all of our web server logs,

16
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,670
along with the purchase data that's in our traditional data warehouse.

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,930
We could give the customer a much better

18
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,360
shopping experience. Which would directly translate into bigger profits.

19
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,380
Yet another example is a movie site like Netflix.

20
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,310
Based on what they know about your viewing habits,

21
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,480
they can recommend movies to you. As you can

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,730
see here, because of what Ian's rated highly before,

23
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,220
this movie is recommend to him. And they can

24
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,030
even predict what rating he would give this movie.
