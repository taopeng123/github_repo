00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,560
There's not one definition for big data, its

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,092
a very subjective term. Most people would certainly

3
00:00:06,092 --> 00:00:08,360
consider a data set of several terabytes to

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,746
be big data. But there are certainly plenty

5
00:00:10,746 --> 00:00:13,581
of people using Hadoop on significantly smaller data

6
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:16,360
sets with really great results. A reasonable definition

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,360
of big data might be, it's data that's

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,490
too big to be processed on a single machine.
