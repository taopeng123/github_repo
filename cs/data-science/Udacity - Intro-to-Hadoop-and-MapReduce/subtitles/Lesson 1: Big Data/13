Sometimes the most unlikely data can be the most useful and lead to savings, due to better planning. For example, a conventional system for coordinating logistics might send the closest truck to a factory to pick up a package. However, it might be that the closest truck is not the best solution. Perhaps there's a traffic jam, or the closest route is actually on small roads that take a long time. Maybe the truck doesn't have enough free space for the new load. So what kind of data would be helpful making a better plan that could save money and time for the company. Would current GPS data for all trucks be useful? Or how about the current plan for each truck for the day? Would it be helpful if we had real time information about the traffic in the area? How about the current load in each truck and its volume and weight.  May be the fuel efficiency of our different vehicles.
