00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,030
By unstructured we mean data arrives in lots of different formats.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,100
For example, a bank might have list of your credit card

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,530
and account transactions. They may also have scans of checks, records

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:14,050
with customer service interactions. Maybe even recordings of those phone calls.

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,550
All that data in a variety of different formats can be

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,160
hard to store and reconcile in a traditional system. And this

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,660
brings us back to volume. You want to store that data

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,830
in its original format so you're not throwing any information away.

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,770
That way you can then process the data later in

10
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,800
different ways. For instance, if we transcribe a call center

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,690
conversation into text we have what people said to customer

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:40,130
service representatives. But if we had the actual recording as well

13
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,710
then later we might develop software which can interpret the

14
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,980
tone of voice the customer uses. And that might lead to

15
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,790
a very different interpretation of the data. And the nice

16
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,860
things about Hadoop is that it doesn't care what format your

17
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,010
data comes in. Unlike a traditional database, you can store the

18
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,120
data in its raw format and manipulate it and reformat it later.
