Hi, welcome to the introduction to Hadoop and MapReduce. I'm Sarah Sproehnle. I'm the vice president of educational services at Cloudera, the company that helps develop, support, and manage Apache Hadoop.  >> And I'm Ian Wrigley, I'm Cloudera's senior curriculum manager. Between us, Sarah and I have been responsible for bringing Hadoop training to well over 20,000 people. And we're excited to bring it to a much larger audience with Udacity. So during this course, we're going to talk about what Big Data is? What Hadoop is? Why Hadoop's useful? And we're going to teach you how to write map reduce code.  >> In fact, by the end of the course, you'll write a MapReduce program that efficiently processes a very large web server log. And by the end of lesson two, you'll already be running a MapReduce job in Apache Hadoop. So let's start. In this lesson we'll talk about what is Big Data. We'll talk about the problems that it creates, and then how Apache Hadoop addresses those problems.
