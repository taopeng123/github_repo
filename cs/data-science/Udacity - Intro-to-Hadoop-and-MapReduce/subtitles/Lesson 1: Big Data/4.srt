Most people would consider all orders across hundreds

00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,220
can imagine that the order details for a single

00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,450
store or one person's individual stock portfolio, could

be stored in a traditional relational database system. Maybe

stores, and the entire data from the New York Stock Exchange.
