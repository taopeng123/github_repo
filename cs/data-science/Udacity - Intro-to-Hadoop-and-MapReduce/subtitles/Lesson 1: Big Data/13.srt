00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,440
Sometimes the most unlikely data can be the most useful and

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,240
lead to savings, due to better planning. For example, a conventional system

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,950
for coordinating logistics might send the closest truck to a factory to

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,300
pick up a package. However, it might be that the closest truck

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,810
is not the best solution. Perhaps there's a traffic jam, or

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,580
the closest route is actually on small roads that take a long

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,390
time. Maybe the truck doesn't have enough free space for the new

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,640
load. So what kind of data would be helpful making a better

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,640
plan that could save money and time for

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,340
the company. Would current GPS data for all trucks

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,260
be useful? Or how about the current plan for each truck for the day? Would it be

12
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,270
helpful if we had real time information about

13
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,790
the traffic in the area? How about the current

14
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,470
load in each truck and its volume and weight.

15
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,670
May be the fuel efficiency of our different vehicles.
