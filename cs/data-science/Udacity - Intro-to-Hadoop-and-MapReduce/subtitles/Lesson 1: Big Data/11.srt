The second v is data variety. For a long time,

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,910
people have used databases such as SQL Server, or MySQL,

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,110
or big data warehouses from companies like Oracle and IBM

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,880
to store their data. The problem is that to store

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,260
data in systems like that, the data needs to be

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,460
able to fit in pre-defined tables. And a lot of

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,780
the data that we deal with these days, tends to

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,490
be what we call unstructured or semi-structured data. So Sarah

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,740
can give us some examples of that.
