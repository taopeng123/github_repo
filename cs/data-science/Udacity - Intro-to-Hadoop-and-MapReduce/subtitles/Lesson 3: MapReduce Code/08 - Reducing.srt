1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,380
We need to know current cost, so we'll read

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:06,040
that in. We're also keeping track of the total

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,230
sales. That will require a variable. We need to

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,455
store both the current store and the previous store

5
00:00:12,455 --> 00:00:15,230
we've seen, so that we can tell when we're

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,210
changing keys. In other words, when we go from

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,660
the Miami Line to the New York City Line.

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,960
However, the cost of the previous line is not useful.
