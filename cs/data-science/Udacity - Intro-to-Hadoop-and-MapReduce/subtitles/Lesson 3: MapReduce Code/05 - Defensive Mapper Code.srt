1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,160
In this case, we're checking to see that

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,700
the line has six fields. If it doesn't, we'll

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,720
ignore that line. Another good thing to do would

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,510
be to check that the cost is actually a

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,460
number. Assuming that line is okay, we'll simply

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,950
write out our intermediate data in the form of

7
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,420
a key, then a tab, then a value. And

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,520
we'll loop back around and do the next line.
