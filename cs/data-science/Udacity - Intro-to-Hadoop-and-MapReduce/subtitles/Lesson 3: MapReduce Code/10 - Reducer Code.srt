00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,290
At the end of this code, we are not done,

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,850
because we have not processed the last key. Be careful when

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,430
you exit the loop. We haven't yet output the data

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,160
for the last key. That's what these two last lines are

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,310
for. We write out the last key and value. If

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,090
we didn't have these two, we would not have the result

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,940
for the final store. Now let's have Ian talk about

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,880
testing the code and then actually running it on a cluster.
