In order to launch the SettingsActivity, we modify

0:00:03.118,0:00:07.070
Mainactivity.java, in the On options item selected method.

0:00:07.070,0:00:09.360
When the Settings Menu Item is selected, we

0:00:09.360,0:00:13.590
create a new, explicit intent, to the SettingsActivity Class.

0:00:13.590,0:00:16.700
We call Start activity, to launch this intent.

0:00:16.700,0:00:19.290
We don't call StartActivity for result because we're

0:00:19.290,0:00:22.640
not expecting a result from the SettingsActivity. Similarly

0:00:22.640,0:00:25.400
in the detail activity class, when the settings menu

0:00:25.400,0:00:28.550
is selected, we launch a new intent to SettingsActivity.
