We start by right-clicking on our package name to create the new activity from the Blank Activity with Fragment template. So for name, we use DetailActivity, and again, the hierarchical parent of this class is going to be our main activity. So as you can see, we now have a new DetailActivity along with the XML for activity_detail and a fragment associated with that activity. Great! You're done. But we still aren't launching our new activity.
