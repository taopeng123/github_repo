In the fragment detailed layout, a text view is already defined. We have to assign it an ID so that within the detail fragment of detail activity we can use find view by ID to find the text view. To determine the forecast info that the text view should display. We can access the intent that the detail activity was launched by. We're going to use this inside of onCreateView.  [SOUND] Since we added an intent extra with the forecast data there. We can read that intent extra back to display in the text view, as you can see we pulled the forecast string from the intent find our rootView and then set the text to that forecast string
