Done already? Let me show you how it's done. As I said before, we get the forecast by calling getItem from the forecast adapter. And here's how we actually display the toast. Note that the context is actually available through getActivity in our fragment. However, it won't do anything unless we also show the toast. Displaying a toast is useful to see how an Android interaction works. But this method should really be used to start our detail activity. This is what we'll do next.
