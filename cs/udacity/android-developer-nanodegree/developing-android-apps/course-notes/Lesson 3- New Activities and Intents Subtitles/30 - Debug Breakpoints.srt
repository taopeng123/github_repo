0:00:00.370,0:00:03.920
I'll show you how we can add breakpoints in our code. Go ahead and

0:00:03.920,0:00:06.960
click on the screen bug icon, to attach the debugger.

0:00:11.650,0:00:15.708
We'll go to the Settings menu. In the SettingsActivity I'm going to add two

0:00:15.708,0:00:20.492
breakpoints, in the onPreferenceChange method. I'm going to add a breakpoint at

0:00:20.492,0:00:24.790
line 59 in the case of a ListPreference when it's about to set the summary. I'm

0:00:24.790,0:00:29.170
also going to add a breakpoint at line 63, when it's not a ListPreference and it

0:00:29.170,0:00:34.120
sets the summary. Let's go into the app to try it out. Tap on the Location and

0:00:34.120,0:00:38.530
change the postal code. If you hit OK, then it triggers the breakpoint to

0:00:38.530,0:00:42.140
stop at right here. These are the values of the variables at this time.

0:00:42.140,0:00:47.110
And we see the new postal code here. You can step over or into the method for

0:00:47.110,0:00:51.960
more details. Or you can hit Play to continue. Or Stop to stop the debugger.

0:00:53.160,0:00:57.410
Let's hit Play to continue. And then we see that the [UNKNOWN] has been

0:00:57.410,0:01:01.800
updated to the, the preference summary, is the new postal code. Let's try it for

0:01:01.800,0:01:06.830
Temperature Units. They tap here, and then select Imperial.

0:01:06.830,0:01:11.190
It triggers this breakpoint in the ListPreference case. We hit Play to continue,

0:01:11.190,0:01:14.760
and then we see that, Imperial is now the preference summary.
