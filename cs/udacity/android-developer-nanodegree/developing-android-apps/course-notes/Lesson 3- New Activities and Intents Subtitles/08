You're going to use Android Studio to create the detail activity from the blank activity with fragment template.  The template asks for the hierarchical parent of detail activity, which defines the up button noted by the app icon, and a left pointing carrot here. But what does up mean? If you mapped out a hierarchy of all screens in the sunshine app, the root of the tree would be the main activity, and it's child would be the detail activity. So, the app goes to the main activity. While the back button can achieve the same effect, it can also bring you back home or to another app, depending on your history of screens. Up will always navigate you within the same app to the parent, regardless of how you arrived at this screen. Create the detail activity now, and look at how the activity is declared in the Android manifest file.
