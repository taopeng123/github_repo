Sunshine looks something like this, but it doesn't show most of the fun information we have about the weather. We want to show a detailed view when the user clicks on a day within the list.

But it will contain all sorts of great weathery details, things that weather nerds love such as barometric pressure and that navigators love such as wind speed and direction eventually, but baby steps.
