50. That's how many apps were available in

0:00:03.320,0:00:05.680
Android Market as Google Play was named when

0:00:05.680,0:00:08.750
it first launched alongside the first Android device

0:00:08.750,0:00:11.800
in 2008. A few days later, Android Market

0:00:11.800,0:00:14.200
opened for all app developers to register and

0:00:14.200,0:00:17.150
start publishing their apps without any review or

0:00:17.150,0:00:21.910
validation requirements from Google, OEMs, or carriers. For

0:00:21.910,0:00:25.065
us as developers, the ability to distribute apps and

0:00:25.065,0:00:28.300
the possibility of monetizing them through up front payments

0:00:28.300,0:00:31.320
in app billing and advertising directly to the owners of

0:00:31.320,0:00:33.920
over a billion android devices is one of the

0:00:33.920,0:00:38.860
most exciting opportunities made possible by the android ecosystem. Growing

0:00:38.860,0:00:41.830
up the dark days before smartphones and the internet,

0:00:41.830,0:00:43.770
if I wanted a new game or app I had

0:00:43.770,0:00:45.860
to go to a physical store and pay for a

0:00:45.860,0:00:50.650
cardboard box filled with floppy disks or CDROMs. As developers

0:00:50.650,0:00:52.680
a big part of our business plan back then

0:00:52.680,0:00:55.830
was how to get those boxes of our software onto

0:00:55.830,0:00:58.900
those shelves. Or in the world of mobile, how

0:00:58.900,0:01:01.350
to secure a carrier or OEM deal to get our

0:01:01.350,0:01:05.500
apps preloaded onto the devices. Today I can install

0:01:05.500,0:01:07.992
over a million apps of games created by tens if

0:01:07.992,0:01:12.400
not hundreds and thousands of developers via Google Play, all

0:01:12.400,0:01:16.010
with a click of a button. That's translated into tens

0:01:16.010,0:01:19.070
of billions of app installs. An incredible opportunity to

0:01:19.070,0:01:23.000
distribute apps to Android users in hundreds of countries.

0:01:23.000,0:01:25.650
Now, in the early days of Android, being fast

0:01:25.650,0:01:28.840
and launching first was a pretty solid strategy for success,

0:01:28.840,0:01:31.910
but as those first 50 apps quickly grew to

0:01:31.910,0:01:35.300
hundreds, thousands, and now over a million apps, it takes

0:01:35.300,0:01:37.710
a lot more than speed to stand out in

0:01:37.710,0:01:41.320
the crowd. These days the tables stakes are a base

0:01:41.320,0:01:44.830
line of quality and willingness to create great experiences

0:01:44.830,0:01:48.500
for all your users. Of course app quality can

0:01:48.500,0:01:52.360
be somewhat subjective, but over the years we've identified

0:01:52.360,0:01:55.200
the core criteria that users identify with apps of

0:01:55.200,0:01:58.130
high quality. And to make your life easier, they're

0:01:58.130,0:02:00.940
all available on the Android developer site for you

0:02:00.940,0:02:03.440
to review. This is the same checklist that the

0:02:03.440,0:02:06.590
merchandising team for Google Play used to ensure only apps

0:02:06.590,0:02:09.130
of quality are featured in their promotions and

0:02:09.130,0:02:12.800
editor's choice categories. And they include everything, from following

0:02:12.800,0:02:16.130
the app design guidelines to supporting different screen orientations,

0:02:16.130,0:02:19.410
tablets, and other devices. And of course ensuring that

0:02:19.410,0:02:22.860
your app is stable and performant. So, with over

0:02:22.860,0:02:25.780
a million apps already available in Google Play it's

0:02:25.780,0:02:28.680
no longer just a numbers game. We don't need

0:02:28.680,0:02:32.570
just more apps or games, or even more developers.

0:02:32.570,0:02:36.770
What we want is high quality apps from great developers, like you.
