The solution is to lauch an explicit intent to the Detail Activity Class. We'll go to On Create View, where our On Item click listener is defined. To pass in the Weather Forecast information, we can use an intent extra, which is a key value pair in the Intent. We use the key name, Intent.extratext, but we can use any string for the key. As long as we use the same key when reading the information out.  Just as in the toast, we obtain the forecast data from the current list item, by calling get item on the adapter at the given position. Once we've added the intent, we just start the activity.
