To move from one activity. In this case, the MainActivity in our sunshine app, to another, here the DetailActivity, we call StartActivity. But note that when using the StartActivity method, rather than specifying the class name of the activity to start directly, that class name is packaged explicitly within an intent. The basic premise is simple. Whenever you need your app components to communicate with each other, or the system, you use intents to identify the target destination. Starting activities within your app is the simplest example. [SOUND] With your intent explicitly indicating the target using the context and a class name of the activity. Intents that use the name of the component you're targeting directly, are known as explicit intents.
