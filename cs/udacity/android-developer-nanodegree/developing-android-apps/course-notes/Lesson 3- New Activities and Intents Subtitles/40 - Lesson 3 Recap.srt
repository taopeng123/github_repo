In this lesson we added new activities to our

0:00:02.440,0:00:05.950
apps and explored ways to structure and navigate between them.

0:00:05.950,0:00:08.370
And that meant learning all about intents and how

0:00:08.370,0:00:12.150
they're used in Android. Next up in Lesson 4, we're

0:00:12.150,0:00:14.740
going to learn about the activity life cycle and make

0:00:14.740,0:00:18.150
our apps that much more useful by saving data. We'll

0:00:18.150,0:00:20.620
begin to databases and learn about content providers, but

0:00:20.620,0:00:24.230
first let's take another journey into the history of Android.
