So, how did the system know that the Maps

0:00:02.330,0:00:05.564
app could handle this Intent? The activity within the

0:00:05.564,0:00:09.720
Maps app included an intent filter like this one

0:00:09.720,0:00:13.140
within its manifest entry. It indicates that the Maps

0:00:13.140,0:00:17.100
app is capable of performing this view action on

0:00:17.100,0:00:19.980
all data which has a geo scheme. You can

0:00:19.980,0:00:22.250
use intent filters for your activities to define the

0:00:22.250,0:00:25.470
actions they're capable of performing, and optionally, the kind

0:00:25.470,0:00:27.700
of data that they can perform it on. So,

0:00:27.700,0:00:30.194
when you use an implicit intent to address or

0:00:30.194,0:00:32.630
request to start an activity, much like you did

0:00:32.630,0:00:37.600
with Catherine and the openweathermap.org link, Android resolves this request

0:00:37.600,0:00:40.850
by checking the intent filters of every activity that's

0:00:40.850,0:00:44.150
installed on the device until it finds the best possible

0:00:44.150,0:00:47.880
match. If multiple activities match, as in the case

0:00:47.880,0:00:50.570
with the web url, the user is given a choice.
