On app launch, I know that you're probably tired of seeing the dummy data and

0:00:03.650,0:00:06.721
needing to hit the refresh button for real data every single time.

0:00:06.721,0:00:10.630
I'm going to show you how to display the data using the current settings each

0:00:10.630,0:00:14.250
time the activity is loaded. In forecast fragment,

0:00:14.250,0:00:17.530
we just refactored the code so that when the refresh button is selected,

0:00:17.530,0:00:21.250
we call this helper method, updateWeather. Now that it's in a helper method,

0:00:21.250,0:00:25.160
we can also call it from the onStart method. We over write onStart so

0:00:25.160,0:00:27.970
that the refresh happens whenever the fragment starts.

0:00:27.970,0:00:31.950
This will cause the weather data to appear. We'll learn all about on start, and

0:00:31.950,0:00:35.360
the rest of the android life cycle in the next lesson. At this point,

0:00:35.360,0:00:39.190
we can also remove all the fake data that we had in the onCreateView method.

0:00:39.190,0:00:44.250
Then we pass in an empty array list to the ArrayAdapter. Now we can test this.

0:00:44.250,0:00:46.510
We need to make sure that this is the first app launch and

0:00:46.510,0:00:49.820
that it wasn't already running,. So if it's already running, kill it.

0:00:49.820,0:00:51.240
And then tap to open the app,

0:00:51.240,0:00:54.820
and then you should see the actual weather data immediately. Under settings we

0:00:54.820,0:00:59.310
can change the location to be the pairs postal code. We hit OK, and

0:00:59.310,0:01:02.950
then return to the main list, and then we see that the weather data has updated.
