First, we create our settings activity, and this is the code that we got from the gist. Then, in the Android Manifest, we declare the settings activity.  We give it an activity named Settings, which is declared in the Strings file.  We also declare the main activity as the parent activity. That way, when you hit the up button in the settings activity, it will return back to the main activity.
