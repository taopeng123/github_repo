To make the preferences appear on the phone, we

0:00:02.650,0:00:05.730
need to modify settings activity. In the on-create method

0:00:05.730,0:00:08.270
we're going to replace this to do with some code.

0:00:09.290,0:00:14.111
We're going to call addPreferencesFromResource with the pref_general xml

0:00:14.111,0:00:16.700
that we defined. Then we need to bind the

0:00:16.700,0:00:20.780
preference summary to the value of the location preference.

0:00:20.780,0:00:23.320
This means that when the user changes the preference,

0:00:23.320,0:00:26.820
the summary value underneath the label will be updated.

0:00:26.820,0:00:29.090
If you look at the declaration of this method,

0:00:29.090,0:00:31.640
we see that for a given preference, it sets a

0:00:31.640,0:00:34.590
preference change listener on it. If you scroll to

0:00:34.590,0:00:37.870
the top, you see that the settings activity actually implements

0:00:37.870,0:00:41.580
the interface on preference change listener. That method is

0:00:41.580,0:00:44.990
found down below, where we override the on preference change

0:00:44.990,0:00:48.380
method. Remember that our location preference is actually an

0:00:48.380,0:00:52.010
edit text preference. So, it won't fall into this case,

0:00:52.010,0:00:54.940
but it will fall in this case down here. Then,

0:00:54.940,0:00:56.970
in the settings UI you can see that the summary

0:00:56.970,0:01:00.240
is now this value. Make these changes in your app.

0:01:00.240,0:01:02.680
See the instructor notes for the lines of code you need.
