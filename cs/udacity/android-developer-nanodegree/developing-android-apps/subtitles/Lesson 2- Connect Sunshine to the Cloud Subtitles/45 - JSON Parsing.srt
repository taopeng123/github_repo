0:00:00.410,0:00:02.800
We want the FetchWeatherTask to return an array

0:00:02.800,0:00:05.520
of string forecasts. That means we need to

0:00:05.520,0:00:08.380
modify the return type of the async task.

0:00:09.730,0:00:12.630
Then in the doInBackground method, after we've read

0:00:12.630,0:00:15.390
in the input string, we perform this code.

0:00:16.850,0:00:20.200
We call the helper method getWeatherDataFromJson and we

0:00:20.200,0:00:22.660
pass in the forecastJson string as well as

0:00:22.660,0:00:25.475
the number of forecast days. We also catch

0:00:25.475,0:00:30.180
any Json exceptions if there's a problem with parsing. We

0:00:30.180,0:00:33.080
wanted to verify that the string array of forecast data

0:00:33.080,0:00:37.960
is correct. So, within the getWeatherDataFromJson method, we added some

0:00:37.960,0:00:40.720
logging statements to print out each element of the array.
