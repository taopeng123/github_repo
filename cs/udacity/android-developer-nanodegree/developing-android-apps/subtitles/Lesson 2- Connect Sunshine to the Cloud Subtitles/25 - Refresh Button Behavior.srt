Now that we have the menu XML, add the code in

0:00:02.680,0:00:05.590
the fragment to inflate it. You can leave a placeholder for

0:00:05.590,0:00:09.020
when the Refresh button is selected. This is what it should

0:00:09.020,0:00:11.740
look when you're done. You should see the Refresh menu item there,

0:00:11.740,0:00:14.730
but tapping on it doesn't do anything. That's fine for now.

0:00:14.730,0:00:18.600
If needed, you can look at mainactivity.java for reference. If you get

0:00:18.600,0:00:21.570
stuck and don't see the menu item appear, try to answer

0:00:21.570,0:00:25.630
this question first: what fragment method do you need to call in

0:00:25.630,0:00:28.430
order to report that it has menu options to display?
