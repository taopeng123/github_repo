The main advantage of the AsyncTask is that you get

0:00:02.740,0:00:05.630
to focus on your app logic, what you need to do

0:00:05.630,0:00:08.100
on the background thread, and what you need to do when

0:00:08.100,0:00:10.490
it comes back to the main thread. You don't have to

0:00:10.490,0:00:14.026
worry about the details of threads and handlers. Of the methods

0:00:14.026,0:00:18.050
that I showed you, only doInBackground is required to be implemented.

0:00:18.050,0:00:22.670
onPostExecute is optional as well as some other methods. For each

0:00:22.670,0:00:26.150
method, tell us whether it's on the main or background thread.

0:00:26.150,0:00:30.260
You have a 50% chance of getting each one correct or a 100%

0:00:30.260,0:00:32.930
if you actually go check the java doc, so go do that now.
