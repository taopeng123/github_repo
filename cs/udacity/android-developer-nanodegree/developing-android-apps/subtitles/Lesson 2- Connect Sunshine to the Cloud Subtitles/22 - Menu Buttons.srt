Thanks Raido, with that in mind let's add

0:00:02.790,0:00:05.450
a Refresh Menu button to our app. For temporary

0:00:05.450,0:00:07.920
purposes only though, otherwise Raido would be mad at

0:00:07.920,0:00:11.882
us. On Android, menu options are defined in XML

0:00:11.882,0:00:14.440
and they can be declared for fragments or

0:00:14.440,0:00:18.390
activities. When the fragment or activity is created, it

0:00:18.390,0:00:21.790
inflates this XML into the actual menu items in

0:00:21.790,0:00:25.440
the app. You'll see that there are Action buttons

0:00:25.440,0:00:28.230
which are menu items that appear in the Action bar,

0:00:28.230,0:00:31.670
such as this Search Menu item. This space is reserved

0:00:31.670,0:00:34.550
for the most prominent actions in your app. Then anything

0:00:34.550,0:00:37.990
else that's less important falls into the overflow menu by

0:00:37.990,0:00:40.790
tapping on this button with the three dots. These menu

0:00:40.790,0:00:44.560
items are ordered from most frequently used to least frequently

0:00:44.560,0:00:47.550
used. And on larger devices that have more screen real

0:00:47.550,0:00:50.710
estate, you can specify that some of these menu items can

0:00:50.710,0:00:54.120
actually go into the Action bar if there's room. If

0:00:54.120,0:00:57.160
you go back to our project in the Resources folder

0:00:57.160,0:00:59.660
which is called res, there is a Menu folder and

0:00:59.660,0:01:03.990
inside that there's a main.xml file. If you open that up

0:01:03.990,0:01:06.360
you see the menu layout XML, and that there's a

0:01:06.360,0:01:10.130
single menu option defined for Settings. It will never show up

0:01:10.130,0:01:12.350
as an action in the Action bar, meaning that it

0:01:12.350,0:01:15.780
will be in the Overflow menu. You can verify this by

0:01:15.780,0:01:18.880
checking the app on your phone. To define the ordering

0:01:18.880,0:01:22.200
of menu items, you can just add multiple items to this

0:01:22.200,0:01:24.580
XML file, and then they will show up in that order

0:01:24.580,0:01:27.680
in the app. If you don't like the order though, and

0:01:27.680,0:01:30.460
you want to explicitly set it, then you can specify

0:01:30.460,0:01:34.030
this order in Category, value. Right now it's set as 100,

0:01:34.030,0:01:37.460
so that the Settings menu will be at the bottom of

0:01:37.460,0:01:40.040
all the other menu options that we define in our app.

0:01:41.080,0:01:44.250
The only Menu option that should show up below the Settings

0:01:44.250,0:01:47.450
menu is the Help menu. Check out the link for more details.
