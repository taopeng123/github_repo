You'll also notice in the sample code that we

0:00:02.540,0:00:07.150
have lines that call log.e, which log error messages. With

0:00:07.150,0:00:09.920
the adb command line tool and with the device plugged

0:00:09.920,0:00:13.580
in, you can type adb logcat to see the debug

0:00:13.580,0:00:16.770
and error messages that are being printed to the logcat.

0:00:16.770,0:00:19.610
For more details on the logcat options, see the link

0:00:19.610,0:00:22.670
below. Another way to view the logs, is to use

0:00:22.670,0:00:25.610
Android Studio. If you click on the Screen Android button,

0:00:25.610,0:00:28.486
it launches the Android Device Monitor. Which includes the

0:00:28.486,0:00:31.950
DDMS tool that Rado mentioned earlier. Then click on a

0:00:31.950,0:00:34.400
device and you can see that our app here, is

0:00:34.400,0:00:37.580
a running process. If you click on the LogCat tab,

0:00:37.580,0:00:40.000
then you all these log messages here, which is what

0:00:40.000,0:00:44.010
we saw with adb logcat. Now try viewing the logs

0:00:44.010,0:00:46.910
yourself with either of those methods. If you do both,

0:00:46.910,0:00:49.950
then you get brownie points. Check this box to proceed.
