So now you've taken a UI with mock data

0:00:02.100,0:00:04.390
and learned how to update with the real data. You

0:00:04.390,0:00:06.955
learned how to use permissions, move time consuming processes

0:00:06.955,0:00:09.540
of the UI thread, and were introduced to the basics

0:00:09.540,0:00:12.410
of network I/O. Join us again in lesson three,

0:00:12.410,0:00:14.990
where we'll create more activities and learn how to navigate

0:00:14.990,0:00:17.700
between them. But first, come with me as I take
