0:00:00.340,0:00:03.360
For the solution we look for the list array.

0:00:03.360,0:00:07.070
Each element in the list represents one days forecast. Given

0:00:07.070,0:00:09.860
the day index we find the temperature node and then

0:00:09.860,0:00:12.700
the max temperature. And this is what the code would

0:00:12.700,0:00:15.340
look like. We change the JSON string into a JSON

0:00:15.340,0:00:18.590
object. Then we look for the list array. Within that

0:00:18.590,0:00:20.730
we find the day we care about. Then we look

0:00:20.730,0:00:23.660
for the temp node. And then find the max temperature.
