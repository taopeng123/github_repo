The URL that we built looks good and the JSON

0:00:03.360,0:00:07.010
string from the server also looks good. However, it still is

0:00:07.010,0:00:09.840
one long string. Let's look at it more carefully to see

0:00:09.840,0:00:12.770
what data we should extract from it. In order to make

0:00:12.770,0:00:15.500
sense of the string that comes back from the server, we

0:00:15.500,0:00:20.090
can put it through a JSON formatter or a JSON prettifier.

0:00:20.090,0:00:22.420
If you Google for those terms, you'll be able to find

0:00:22.420,0:00:25.530
a helpful tool such as this one. Here, we pasted the

0:00:25.530,0:00:28.550
result of the web query. Then, it formatted the output for

0:00:28.550,0:00:32.549
us showing us the hierarchy of these elements. Now based on

0:00:32.549,0:00:35.200
the wireframes that you saw for the Sunshine app, can you

0:00:35.200,0:00:38.780
tell us which of these leaf nodes we care about extracting?

0:00:38.780,0:00:41.660
Even though we will have to traverse through parent nodes, for

0:00:41.660,0:00:43.960
the purposes of the quiz on the next screen, we're just

0:00:43.960,0:00:47.870
looking at the leaf nodes. Make your selections below on which

0:00:47.870,0:00:51.280
attributes we'll need in order to display the list of forecasts
