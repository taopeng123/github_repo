Before we go any further, I need to

0:00:01.800,0:00:04.110
jump in here. Catherine has already said that

0:00:04.110,0:00:06.410
the refresh button is for debugging only, but

0:00:06.410,0:00:08.600
let's look at why. In real life, you

0:00:08.600,0:00:10.720
should always seek to eliminate the refresh button

0:00:10.720,0:00:12.970
from your app. A good app should work

0:00:12.970,0:00:16.560
like a good butler, giving you what you want before you even have to ask for

0:00:19.360,0:00:19.860
it.

0:00:21.720,0:00:23.720
Much like the Save button, it's a relic of a

0:00:23.720,0:00:27.370
bygone age. That's the best a reassuring safety blanket for those

0:00:27.370,0:00:30.370
of us who grew up with floppy disks. With the ability

0:00:30.370,0:00:33.670
to run background tasks or send messages directly from the server

0:00:33.670,0:00:36.860
to our app, there's really no reason to force users

0:00:36.860,0:00:39.960
to manually hit refresh. But the app is up to date

0:00:39.960,0:00:43.300
and sync with the cloud should be a given. But like

0:00:43.300,0:00:47.230
we said, this is for debugging, so like print line it's

0:00:47.230,0:00:51.370
acceptable for this particular purpose. Let's also take a look at

0:00:51.370,0:00:55.650
our background threading model, which of the following is potential an issue?
