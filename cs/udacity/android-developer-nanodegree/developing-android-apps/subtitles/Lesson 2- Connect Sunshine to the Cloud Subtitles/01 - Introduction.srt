In lesson one, we built a new project with a basic UI backed with mock

0:00:04.180,0:00:06.730
data. In this lesson, we'll hook sunshine up

0:00:06.730,0:00:09.140
with the Cloud, replacing the mock data with

0:00:09.140,0:00:11.397
real weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.

0:00:12.420,0:00:14.320
To do that, we'll learn about the Android

0:00:14.320,0:00:16.860
permission system, Network I/O, and how to move

0:00:16.860,0:00:19.460
time consuming tasks off the main UI thread.
