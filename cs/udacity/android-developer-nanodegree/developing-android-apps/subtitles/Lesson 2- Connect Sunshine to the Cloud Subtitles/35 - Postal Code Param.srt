In the Forecast Fragment, we want to modify the

0:00:02.715,0:00:05.070
FetchWeatherTask, so that we can pass in the

0:00:05.070,0:00:08.730
postal code parameter when we execute that task.

0:00:08.730,0:00:11.370
You can click on this class, to jump

0:00:11.370,0:00:16.780
to where it's defined or you can use this shortcut. And here you see that we

0:00:16.780,0:00:19.640
modified the generic input type, to be a

0:00:19.640,0:00:25.080
string so that the doInBackground method receives string params.

0:00:25.080,0:00:27.783
Now, we only passed in one string param,

0:00:27.783,0:00:30.923
94043. So when you see down here later, we

0:00:30.923,0:00:33.816
can read out the zeroth position in the params

0:00:33.816,0:00:37.520
array, to get that postal code. Notice that we're

0:00:37.520,0:00:40.590
using the UI builder here, and we're appending query

0:00:40.590,0:00:43.830
parameters, one by one. We define constants for these

0:00:43.830,0:00:47.100
query params, as seen here. And for the values,

0:00:47.100,0:00:50.300
we also define them up here. You can imagine

0:00:50.300,0:00:52.590
that in the future these might be configured outside

0:00:52.590,0:00:54.580
of this class, but for now we're just going

0:00:54.580,0:00:57.820
to define them here. To verify that this URI

0:00:57.820,0:01:01.010
was defined properly, we add a verbose log command

0:01:01.010,0:01:04.629
to print out the built URI. Let's verify that

0:01:04.629,0:01:07.460
the log we added actually shows up. In overflow

0:01:07.460,0:01:10.350
menu we tap Refresh. Then we see the log

0:01:10.350,0:01:15.300
tag FetchWeatherTask with our UI printed out. It says

0:01:15.300,0:01:19.610
94043, jSON format metric units, seven days. So this looks correct.
