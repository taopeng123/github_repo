Let's apply what we just learned by opening up

0:00:02.050,0:00:06.390
the MainActivity.java file within our project. We're going to take

0:00:06.390,0:00:08.830
this networking code snippet and move it over to

0:00:08.830,0:00:11.200
it's own AsyncTask, so it runs in a background

0:00:11.200,0:00:14.160
thread. The task is going to be defined within

0:00:14.160,0:00:18.070
this fragment class. But speaking of which, it's actually

0:00:18.070,0:00:21.300
still called PlaceholderFragment. Let's do a little bit of

0:00:21.300,0:00:25.365
refactoring now by giving it a real name. Let's call

0:00:25.365,0:00:28.463
it ForecastFragment. And then you can update it

0:00:28.463,0:00:31.560
in other appropriate places as well. We can also

0:00:31.560,0:00:34.560
move ForecastFragment into its own file that way

0:00:34.560,0:00:38.412
the MainActivity won't get so long and cumbersome. Within

0:00:38.412,0:00:41.284
ForecastFragment we should define a new inner class

0:00:41.284,0:00:45.290
called FetchWeatherTask which extends from AsyncTask. And then you

0:00:45.290,0:00:48.770
can move the networking code snippet here. After you

0:00:48.770,0:00:50.840
make the changes and run your app, it should

0:00:50.840,0:00:53.770
look something like this. There really should be no difference except it

0:00:53.770,0:00:57.290
doesn't crash now. In the next step we will add code to execute

0:00:57.290,0:01:01.300
the task. And later in the lesson, we'll do JSON parsing and updating

0:01:01.300,0:01:05.120
the UI. In the meantime though, make these initial changes to your code.
