When we said that the framework didn't want us

0:00:01.980,0:00:05.080
to run network operations on the main thread, what

0:00:05.080,0:00:08.630
is the main thread? Well, Android apps run by

0:00:08.630,0:00:12.570
default on the main thread, also called the UI thread.

0:00:12.570,0:00:14.900
It handles all the user input as well as

0:00:14.900,0:00:18.060
the output, such as screen drawing. Thus we want

0:00:18.060,0:00:21.760
to avoid any time-consuming operations here, otherwise the URI

0:00:21.760,0:00:25.470
is going to stutter. Instead, kick off a background worker

0:00:25.470,0:00:27.430
thread if you have to do some long-running

0:00:27.430,0:00:32.170
work. This includes doing network calls, decoding bitmaps, or

0:00:32.170,0:00:35.870
reading, and writing from the database. Okay. So, somehow,

0:00:35.870,0:00:37.890
we have to move the networking code off the

0:00:37.890,0:00:39.800
main thread. But how are we going to do

0:00:39.800,0:00:43.180
that? Well there are several options, but let's look

0:00:43.180,0:00:46.610
for the name of the Android class that simplifies

0:00:46.610,0:00:50.520
background thread creation and UI thread synchronization, so that

0:00:50.520,0:00:53.370
the results from the background work will come back onto the

0:00:53.370,0:00:55.710
main thread, and then we can use it to update our

0:00:55.710,0:00:59.740
UI. Search online and figure out the answer to this question

0:00:59.740,0:01:02.740
and then enter the class name in the box. Here's some

0:01:02.740,0:01:04.950
advice for you. If you ever get stuck on how to

0:01:04.950,0:01:07.480
do something in Android and you can't find it on the

0:01:07.480,0:01:12.220
developer's site you can try to check stackoverflow.com. It's a question

0:01:12.220,0:01:16.740
and answer site that many Android developers use as a valuable resource.

0:01:16.740,0:01:18.700
So chances are likely that someone has

0:01:18.700,0:01:20.850
already asked a similar question that you have.
