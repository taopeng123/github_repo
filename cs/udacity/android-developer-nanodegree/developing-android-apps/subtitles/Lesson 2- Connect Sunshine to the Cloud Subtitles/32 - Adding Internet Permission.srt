Thanks Fredo! So, like old times, we're going to

0:00:02.960,0:00:05.800
need to ask for permission. Go ahead and change

0:00:05.800,0:00:08.960
the Android Manifest file, to request the Internet permission.

0:00:08.960,0:00:11.730
And then tell us the exact string name of

0:00:11.730,0:00:14.380
the permission that you used. Run the app

0:00:14.380,0:00:16.760
again, to ensure that it doesn't crash. You can

0:00:16.760,0:00:19.070
also log the output of the network call, to

0:00:19.070,0:00:21.530
verify that you got the weather data back correctly.
