While declaring a commission is required for using a

0:00:03.340,0:00:07.240
camera, making a phone call, or accessing contact details. You

0:00:07.240,0:00:09.440
can do each of these things using a system app

0:00:09.440,0:00:13.340
as an intermediator. Because the camera app, dialer, and contacts

0:00:13.340,0:00:15.090
app will each be used to provide the data

0:00:15.090,0:00:17.950
you request users have the chance to cancel the action

0:00:17.950,0:00:21.300
you initiated giving them run time ability to refuse your

0:00:21.300,0:00:25.830
access. However, UI can only access the user's current location

0:00:25.830,0:00:28.170
if it explicitly declares a user's permission.
