0:00:00.190,0:00:03.660
Now, we should be able to find the most[br]appropriate URL that our app should use.

0:00:04.780,0:00:07.780
Based on the UX wireframes[br]we saw earlier, we want

0:00:07.780,0:00:11.480
the weather forecast for a week's worth[br]of data given a certain postal cost.

0:00:11.480,0:00:16.900
For the purposes of this quiz and our[br]example code that we'll be showing you.

0:00:16.900,0:00:19.440
We'll be using the Mountain View[br]postal code, which is 94043.

0:00:19.440,0:00:25.000
By all means you should use the postal[br]code for your own location.

0:00:25.000,0:00:28.890
Or you can use city name or[br]latitude, longitude coordinates.

0:00:28.890,0:00:31.580
If it doesn't find your[br]location based on postal code.

0:00:31.580,0:00:34.720
Try using postal code followed by[br]a comma, followed by the country code.

0:00:34.720,0:00:37.670
See the discussion forum for[br]more examples.

0:00:37.670,0:00:40.930
Next, we want the response from[br]the server to be in JSON format.

0:00:40.930,0:00:44.600
And we also want the temperatures[br]to be reported in metric units.

0:00:44.600,0:00:47.410
We choose metric for[br]doing the query, but our UI will be

0:00:47.410,0:00:50.815
able to displace celsius or[br]fahrenheit based ion user preferences.

0:00:50.815,0:00:53.330
Wnd we'll just do[br]the conversion ourselves.

0:00:53.330,0:00:56.230
Enter the URL in the box that[br]fulfills these requirements.
