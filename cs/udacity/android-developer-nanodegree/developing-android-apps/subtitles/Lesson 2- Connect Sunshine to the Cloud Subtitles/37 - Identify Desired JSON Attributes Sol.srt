0:00:00.170,0:00:02.180
These are the attributes[br]that we care about.

0:00:02.180,0:00:04.660
You might be wondering[br]why time is not included.

0:00:04.660,0:00:06.750
The weather API provides the date and

0:00:06.750,0:00:10.380
GMT time, but doesn't provide[br]time zones for the location.

0:00:10.380,0:00:13.820
So unfortunately, the date could be[br]incorrect in some cases depending on

0:00:13.820,0:00:15.900
your location and time of day.

0:00:15.900,0:00:16.570
Instead, for

0:00:16.570,0:00:20.200
a more accurate experience, we'll be[br]computing the date ourselves based on

0:00:20.200,0:00:23.150
the device time of when you fetched[br]the weather forecast from the server.
