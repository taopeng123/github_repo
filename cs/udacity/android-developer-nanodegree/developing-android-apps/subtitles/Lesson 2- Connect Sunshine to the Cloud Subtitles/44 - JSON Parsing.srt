Once you've learned how to pars JSON data, it's pretty

0:00:02.800,0:00:04.990
straight forward to be able to pars the rest of the

0:00:04.990,0:00:07.550
fields that we need. Since this isn't a course on

0:00:07.550,0:00:10.520
Java or JSON, we're going to provide you with the parsing

0:00:10.520,0:00:13.210
code in the gist below. And this is what the

0:00:13.210,0:00:16.800
gist looks like. There are three helper methods. The first is

0:00:16.800,0:00:21.280
for formatting dates. The second is for rounding temperatures. The third

0:00:21.280,0:00:25.380
is for turning a forecastJsonStr, into an array of weather forecasts.

0:00:26.420,0:00:29.780
Update the Fetch Weather Tasks to use these helpful functions. And

0:00:29.780,0:00:32.170
the do in background method should return a string array of

0:00:32.170,0:00:35.410
forecasts. You can log the output to check that the array

0:00:35.410,0:00:38.910
is correct. The format of one day's forecast should look like this.
