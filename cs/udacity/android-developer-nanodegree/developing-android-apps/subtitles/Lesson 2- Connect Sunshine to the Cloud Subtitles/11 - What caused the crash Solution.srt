If you run it on your phone, your Apple crashed

0:00:02.830,0:00:06.270
because of a network got main thread exception. We found

0:00:06.270,0:00:08.990
this answer by connecting our device to our computer and

0:00:08.990,0:00:12.790
then checking Android device monitor for the error. You can

0:00:12.790,0:00:15.220
see here that this is our package name and this

0:00:15.220,0:00:18.010
is our process ID. If you search the logs for

0:00:18.010,0:00:22.390
that process ID then our error appears. It's triggered ultimately

0:00:22.390,0:00:25.700
by a network on main thread exception. If you're curious

0:00:25.700,0:00:28.560
as to what line of our code actually caused

0:00:28.560,0:00:30.730
this, you can scroll down the stack trace to

0:00:30.730,0:00:33.940
read more. This is our framework code that you

0:00:33.940,0:00:36.570
can skip and here's where it actually hits our

0:00:36.570,0:00:41.440
app. It's within the placeholder fragment class, in the onCreateView method. And

0:00:41.440,0:00:46.680
it happens in main activity.java file, in line 116. So

0:00:46.680,0:00:51.650
if we go back to the code, on that line you can see that urlConnection.connect

0:00:51.650,0:00:55.210
actually caused the error, and that we can't do that on the main thread.
