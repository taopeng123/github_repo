Now that our app is showing real data, we should take

0:00:02.730,0:00:05.240
a screenshot of our app, so we can remember what it was

0:00:05.240,0:00:08.490
like when we made it this far. I personally like doing this

0:00:08.490,0:00:11.430
throughout the process of building an app, because then I can look

0:00:11.430,0:00:15.190
back, and see how it evolved. I'm going to show you one

0:00:15.190,0:00:18.170
way that you can take a screenshot of your device. Open up

0:00:18.170,0:00:22.080
Android Device Monitor and then click on the device here. Then, click

0:00:22.080,0:00:25.720
on this camera icon, to do a screen capture. When it pops

0:00:25.720,0:00:27.330
up, you can hit Save, and then you're done.

0:00:28.530,0:00:32.140
On certain physical devices, there are actually hardware keys that

0:00:32.140,0:00:35.440
allow you to grab a screenshot. For example, on the

0:00:35.440,0:00:37.910
Nexus 5, you can long press on the volume down

0:00:37.910,0:00:41.620
and the power key, at the same time. That takes

0:00:41.620,0:00:44.530
a screenshot. It gets saved to the Photos app and

0:00:44.530,0:00:46.940
then you can share it out to anyone you want.

0:00:46.940,0:00:49.410
You can show them what an awesome app you're building.
