Let's talk about permissions, when each app APK is installed,

0:00:04.200,0:00:07.290
it's given it's own unique Linux user ID. And each

0:00:07.290,0:00:10.175
app runs within its instance in the Android Virtual machine.

0:00:10.175,0:00:16.946
[SOUND] As a result each app is completely sand boxed.

0:00:16.946,0:00:19.831
[BLANK_AUDIO]

0:00:19.831,0:00:23.051
Its files processes and other resources are inaccessible

0:00:23.051,0:00:26.110
to other apps. This sandboxing approach is used to

0:00:26.110,0:00:29.210
ensure that by default no app can access sensitive

0:00:29.210,0:00:32.250
data or perform actions that could adversely impact other

0:00:32.250,0:00:36.210
apps, the OS, or users. Things like accessing the

0:00:36.210,0:00:39.320
internet, getting the user's location, or reading or modifying

0:00:39.320,0:00:42.660
the contacts database. Rather than asking the user each

0:00:42.660,0:00:45.660
time an app tries to access something sensitive you

0:00:45.660,0:00:48.720
declared permissions that your app requires in it's manifest.

0:00:48.720,0:00:52.130
You can get a list of all of the permission

0:00:52.130,0:00:56.090
your app may require here at the Android developer site.

0:00:56.090,0:00:58.390
So, why not just ask for all the permissions and

0:00:58.390,0:01:01.320
never worry about it again? Well, when users install

0:01:01.320,0:01:04.200
your app their greeted with this dialogue which lists all

0:01:04.200,0:01:06.645
of the permissions that you've requested along with the more

0:01:06.645,0:01:10.770
user-friendly descriptions. Nothing says this app was built by hackers

0:01:10.770,0:01:13.380
who want to steal my data, rob my house, clear out my

0:01:13.380,0:01:16.560
bank account, and take and share nude pictures of me like

0:01:16.560,0:01:19.250
a weather app that wants access to every permission on the

0:01:19.250,0:01:24.100
device. Best practice is to request the absolute minimum of permissions.

0:01:24.100,0:01:26.340
Every time you need to request a new permission, take it

0:01:26.340,0:01:29.390
as a flag to stop and consider if there are other

0:01:29.390,0:01:32.970
alternatives that might achieve the same goal. For example, using an

0:01:32.970,0:01:37.140
intent to launch the camera app, rather than accessing the camera, directly.

0:01:37.140,0:01:39.550
Later, we'll look at ways to share your data with

0:01:39.550,0:01:43.370
other apps, using intents and content providers to create bridges

0:01:43.370,0:01:46.630
between these apps sandboxs. You can declare and use those

0:01:46.630,0:01:48.040
permissions in these instances to

0:01:48.040,0:01:51.080
similarly restrict access to sensitive information.
