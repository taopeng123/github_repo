For the next step, let's do an exercise that focuses

0:00:02.719,0:00:06.400
on extracting out the value of one of those attributes. We're

0:00:06.400,0:00:09.480
going to do this exercise a little bit differently. You'll implement this

0:00:09.480,0:00:12.740
on the Udacity platform. And we'll be able to verify that

0:00:12.740,0:00:16.420
your code is correct. After this video, you'll see an IDE

0:00:16.420,0:00:18.870
like this. Where it contains some starter code, as well as

0:00:18.870,0:00:22.790
some j unit tests in a separate tab. In particular, we

0:00:22.790,0:00:25.780
want you to implement this function, to get the max temperature

0:00:25.780,0:00:28.160
for a day. You're given a weather JSON

0:00:28.160,0:00:30.390
string, formatted the same way as you would get

0:00:30.390,0:00:32.700
from the Open Weather Map service. And you

0:00:32.700,0:00:35.910
also get the day index that we care about.

0:00:35.910,0:00:37.340
Feel free to play around with the code

0:00:37.340,0:00:40.520
in Android Studio, or a separate development environment, before

0:00:40.520,0:00:43.070
you paste your answer here. Or you can use

0:00:43.070,0:00:45.800
the Udacity IDE. Whichever feels more natural to you.
