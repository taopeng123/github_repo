To fetch the data from open weather map within an

0:00:02.390,0:00:05.750
app, first we need to make an HTTP request to the

0:00:05.750,0:00:09.150
API at the URL that we decided on earlier. Then we

0:00:09.150,0:00:11.520
need to read the response from the input stream to get

0:00:11.520,0:00:14.480
a JSON string. It hasn't been parsed yet, but we'll worry

0:00:14.480,0:00:18.080
about that later. Then we clean up by disconnecting the connection

0:00:18.080,0:00:21.300
and closing any input streams. We also log any errors that

0:00:21.300,0:00:25.300
we catch. Since it's a lot of networking boiler plate code,

0:00:25.300,0:00:27.500
we've provided you with a code snippet

0:00:27.500,0:00:29.890
that handles these steps. See the link for

0:00:29.890,0:00:31.990
the GitHub gist below. After you've taken a

0:00:31.990,0:00:34.120
