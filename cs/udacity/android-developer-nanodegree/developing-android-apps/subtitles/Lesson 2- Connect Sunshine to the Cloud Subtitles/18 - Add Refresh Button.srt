As we mentioned before, you're going to still see fake

0:00:02.650,0:00:05.120
data in the app. We'll need to add code to

0:00:05.120,0:00:07.630
actually kick off a background task from the main

0:00:07.630,0:00:10.970
thread. For debugging purposes, it will be nice if we

0:00:10.970,0:00:13.630
can execute the task any time we wanted by

0:00:13.630,0:00:16.980
interacting with the UI somehow. So, we're going to add

0:00:16.980,0:00:20.650
a Refresh menu option for debugging. A warning, though,

0:00:20.650,0:00:23.100
this menu option should not shift in the final app.
