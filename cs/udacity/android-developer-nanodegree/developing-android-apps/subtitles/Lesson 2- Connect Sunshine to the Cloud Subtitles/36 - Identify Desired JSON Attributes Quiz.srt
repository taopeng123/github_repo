The URL that we built looks good, and the JSON string from the server,

0:00:04.390,0:00:08.440
also looks good, however, it still is one long string.

0:00:08.440,0:00:12.170
Let's look at it more carefully to see what data, we should extract from it.

0:00:12.170,0:00:15.400
In order to make sense of the string that comes back from the server.

0:00:15.400,0:00:20.090
We can put it through a JSON formatter or a JSON prettifier.

0:00:20.090,0:00:20.710
If you Google for

0:00:20.710,0:00:24.810
those terms, you'll be able to find a helpful tool, such as this one.

Here we pasted the result of the web query.

0:00:30.110,0:00:33.749
Then it formatted the output for us, showing us the hierarchy of these element.

0:00:34.840,0:00:37.890
Now based on the wire frames that you saw for the sunshine app,

0:00:37.890,0:00:41.680
can you tell us which of these leaf nodes we care about extracting?

0:00:41.680,0:00:45.210
Even though we will have to traverse through parent nodes, for the purposes of

0:00:45.210,0:00:47.870
the quiz on the next screen, we're just looking at the leaf nodes.

0:00:49.080,0:00:51.740
Make your selection below on which attributes we'll need to

0:00:51.740,0:00:53.450
display the list of forecasts.
