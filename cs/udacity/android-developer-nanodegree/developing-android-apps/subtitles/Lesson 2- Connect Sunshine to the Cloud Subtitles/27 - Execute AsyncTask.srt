0:00:00.280,0:00:02.870
Now modify the code so that when the Refresh menu item

0:00:02.870,0:00:08.290
is selected, it executes the FetchWeatherTask. But hang on. When you

0:00:08.290,0:00:12.630
tap on the Refresh button, it actually crashes. Why don't you

0:00:12.630,0:00:15.210
go check the logs to see what error is causing this.
