And now you're done with lesson two. Woohoo. You've made

0:00:03.900,0:00:06.210
a huge step in being able to transfer data from

0:00:06.210,0:00:08.090
a server and bring it all the way down to

0:00:08.090,0:00:13.100
your device. Think about all the possibilities now of valuable information

0:00:13.100,0:00:16.050
you could bring down to users to be available at

0:00:16.050,0:00:20.560
their fingertips. And that's pretty powerful. Speaking about making an impact,

0:00:20.560,0:00:22.560
have you thought about what you're going to do for your

0:00:22.560,0:00:26.540
final project yet? You can choose any topic that you want.

0:00:26.540,0:00:29.570
Share your ideas in the class discussion forum, and

0:00:29.570,0:00:31.686
you can share with your friends on social media too.

Over to beta now, while I take a quick nap

0:00:34.580,0:00:36.790
on this Done pillow. I'll see you in lesson three.
