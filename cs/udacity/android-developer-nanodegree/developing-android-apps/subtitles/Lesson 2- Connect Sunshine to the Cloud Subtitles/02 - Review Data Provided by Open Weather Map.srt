On that note, we're going to make our sunshine app

0:00:02.320,0:00:05.410
100 times better now by connecting it over the network

0:00:05.410,0:00:10.360
to the OpenWeatherMap service. OpenWeatherMap provides a free weather data

0:00:10.360,0:00:13.480
and forecast API. And the site is linked below, so

0:00:13.480,0:00:16.570
you can follow along. By scrolling through the site,

0:00:16.570,0:00:19.600
you can see what type of data is available. It

0:00:19.600,0:00:22.540
also has example queries so you can click on this

0:00:22.540,0:00:25.440
one to see what the weather is like in London.

0:00:25.440,0:00:28.070
It includes a user friendly description of the weather

0:00:28.070,0:00:31.280
condition, such as broken clouds, in this case. And

0:00:31.280,0:00:34.110
we'll use this later in our app. For the

0:00:34.110,0:00:37.060
full list of weather conditions, you can go back to

0:00:37.060,0:00:40.330
the main page. And scroll down. And then, click

0:00:40.330,0:00:42.790
on this link here for the Weather Condition Codes.

0:00:43.950,0:00:45.700
And on this page, we have the full list

0:00:45.700,0:00:51.000
of weather conditions. It contains everything, from scattered clouds to

0:00:51.000,0:00:55.490
freezing rain, or even volcanic ash. I don't know

0:00:55.490,0:00:58.170
about you, but hopefully that doesn't happen too often.
