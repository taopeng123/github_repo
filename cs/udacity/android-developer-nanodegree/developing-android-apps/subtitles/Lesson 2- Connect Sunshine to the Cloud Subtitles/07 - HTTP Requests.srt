In the sample code provided you'll notice

0:00:02.100,0:00:06.000
that we create a Http Url connection. To

0:00:06.000,0:00:08.430
use Http to send and receive data over

0:00:08.430,0:00:10.960
the network, we have two clients on Android.

0:00:10.960,0:00:13.740
The Http Url connection class, as well as

0:00:13.740,0:00:17.700
the patchy Http Client class. Both options support

0:00:17.700,0:00:22.010
Https, streaming uploads and downloads, configurable time outs,

0:00:22.010,0:00:25.460
IPB 6 and connection pooling. We recommend the

0:00:25.460,0:00:28.850
Http Url Connection class because it's general purpose and light

0:00:28.850,0:00:31.730
weight, and it's been optimized to suit the needs of

0:00:31.730,0:00:34.460
most Android apps. To learn more about connecting to the

0:00:34.460,0:00:37.130
network, see the training guide and blog post link below.
