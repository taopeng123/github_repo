In the forecast fragment class, we modify the

0:00:02.880,0:00:08.134
onOptionsItemSelected method. When the Refresh menu item is selected,

0:00:08.134,0:00:11.129
we create a new FetchWeatherTask and then we call

0:00:11.129,0:00:13.489
execute on it. While the call is no longer

0:00:13.489,0:00:16.487
blocking the UI thread because it's an AsyncTask, the

0:00:16.487,0:00:19.390
app will still crash. If we check the logs,

0:00:19.390,0:00:21.920
we see that the app crashed. This time though,

0:00:21.920,0:00:26.030
with a security expression. It says Permission denied and

0:00:26.030,0:00:29.810
ask if you're missing the INTERNET permission or not. And indeed,

0:00:29.810,0:00:32.670
we are missing the INTERNET permission, so we need to request it.
