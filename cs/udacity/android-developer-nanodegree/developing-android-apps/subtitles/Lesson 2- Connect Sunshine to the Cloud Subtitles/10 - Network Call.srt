Cool. Now that we know that we can use

0:00:01.890,0:00:04.600
logging to debug our app, we're going to return to

0:00:04.600,0:00:07.210
this networking code snippet here and drop it into

0:00:07.210,0:00:11.380
the sunshine app to query for actual weather data. Open

0:00:11.380,0:00:14.550
up your project in main activity.java. In this class,

0:00:14.550,0:00:18.420
scroll down to the placeholder fragment class within the placeholder

0:00:18.420,0:00:22.010
fragment class in the on create view method, scroll down

0:00:22.010,0:00:25.490
and go ahead and add the networking code snippet here.

0:00:25.490,0:00:30.410
To get her blank, is pasted below again if you need it. You may need to enable

0:00:30.410,0:00:33.700
these options in auto import or add the imports

0:00:33.700,0:00:37.990
manually. See the instructions below. When you run the

0:00:37.990,0:00:40.930
app, you'll see that is crashes. Use log

0:00:40.930,0:00:43.430
cat to figure out which error is the guilty

0:00:43.430,0:00:47.290
culprit that caused the crash. We're assuming that for

0:00:47.290,0:00:50.080
this quiz question. You're using a device that's running

0:00:50.080,0:00:53.160
honeycomb or later. Use the emulator if needed.
