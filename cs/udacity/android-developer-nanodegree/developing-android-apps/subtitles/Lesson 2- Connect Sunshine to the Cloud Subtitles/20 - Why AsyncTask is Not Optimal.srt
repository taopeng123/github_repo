Well, the transfer isn't happening on the UI thread, but

0:00:03.040,0:00:05.750
that's not a bad thing. In fact, it's good that it's

0:00:05.750,0:00:07.900
not happening on the UI thread. So that's not a problem

0:00:07.900,0:00:11.910
either. Data transfers are an integral part of most modern smartphone

0:00:11.910,0:00:15.200
apps, so that's not a problem. The real problem is that

0:00:15.200,0:00:18.080
the transfer is happening on a thread whose lifetime is tied

0:00:18.080,0:00:21.800
explicitly to a UI component, in this case an activity. So

0:00:21.800,0:00:25.330
if the activity is terminated by something like a screen rotation,

0:00:25.330,0:00:27.080
the transfer will also be terminated.
