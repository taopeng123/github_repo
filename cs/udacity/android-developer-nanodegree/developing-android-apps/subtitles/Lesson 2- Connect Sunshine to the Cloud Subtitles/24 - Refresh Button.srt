Here's the code for the Refresh button in

0:00:02.550,0:00:06.060
the forecastfragment menu XML file. We want it to

0:00:06.060,0:00:09.160
appear in the overflow menu, so we set showAsAction

0:00:09.160,0:00:12.280
as never. We also declare the string. You can

0:00:12.280,0:00:15.560
find the string here in the strings.xml file, which

0:00:15.560,0:00:17.810
is located in the values folder, which is in

0:00:17.810,0:00:21.230
the res folder. You can get your strings.xml file

0:00:21.230,0:00:25.340
translated into different languages. This adds additional values folders,

0:00:25.340,0:00:28.364
under Res. For example, you would have

0:00:28.364,0:00:33.230
values-es, for Spanish, values-fr for French. And

0:00:33.230,0:00:35.450
within each of those values folders, you

0:00:35.450,0:00:37.660
would have a strings.xml file, which would

0:00:37.660,0:00:39.940
contain the localized strings for that language.

Since translation does cost money, as a

0:00:43.170,0:00:45.200
pro tip, you can mark strings that

0:00:45.200,0:00:50.210
you don't need translated using translatable=false. For example,

0:00:50.210,0:00:53.560
if it's a proper name or if it's for debugging like this one,

0:00:53.560,0:00:57.180
then you can indicate to the translator that they can skip over this strings
