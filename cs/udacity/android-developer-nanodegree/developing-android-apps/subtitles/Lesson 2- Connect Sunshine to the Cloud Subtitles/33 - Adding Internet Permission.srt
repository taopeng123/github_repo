The answer is android.permission.INTERNET. I'll show you now,

0:00:03.880,0:00:06.380
where it's located in the code. Under the

0:00:06.380,0:00:09.180
main folder open up the Android manifest.xml file.

0:00:10.420,0:00:13.660
Within the Android manifest file, we declare uses

0:00:13.660,0:00:16.800
permission, with the name of the permission. We

0:00:16.800,0:00:18.880
verified that the data returned is correct by

0:00:18.880,0:00:21.810
adding a verbose log statement for printing out

0:00:21.810,0:00:26.300
the forecastJsonStr. This is in the fetch weather task.

0:00:26.300,0:00:29.830
We can verify that it's going to show up in the logs. For this example, I'm

0:00:29.830,0:00:33.890
going to use the command line. These are the real time logs, and then if I

0:00:33.890,0:00:39.120
hit refresh, then I see the weather data here. The verbose log, and this is our

0:00:39.120,0:00:43.040
log tag fetch weather task. Here's the forecastJsonStr,

0:00:43.040,0:00:45.070
and this is all the output from the server.
