The solution is that we need to call

0:00:01.895,0:00:05.760
Fragment.setHasOptionsMenu(true). That way, we'll

0:00:05.760,0:00:07.910
get appropriate options menu callback

0:00:07.910,0:00:09.850
methods in the fragment, so that we can

0:00:09.850,0:00:12.120
inflate the menu and for when a menu item

0:00:12.120,0:00:15.190
is selected. And this is where the fragment

0:00:15.190,0:00:17.760
inflates the menu. Remember from before that in the

0:00:17.760,0:00:21.310
ForecastFragment class, we have a public empty constructor, and

0:00:21.310,0:00:25.650
we also override onCreateView? We also define fetchWeatherTask here.

0:00:25.650,0:00:28.020
Now, we're going to overide an additional fragment life

0:00:28.020,0:00:31.340
cycle method called onCreate. This is where the fragment

0:00:31.340,0:00:34.691
is created, and this happens before the onCreate view

0:00:34.691,0:00:37.790
method, which is where the UI gets initialized. So, in

0:00:37.790,0:00:41.570
onCreate, we're going to call setHasOptionsMenu to be true to

0:00:41.570,0:00:44.430
indicate that we want call backs for these methods.

0:00:44.430,0:00:47.560
When onCreateOptionsMenu is called, we're going to inflate the menu

0:00:47.560,0:00:51.510
layout that we defined earlier called forecast fragment. We'll also

0:00:51.510,0:00:55.090
get notified when a menu item is selected. When a menu item with

0:00:55.090,0:00:57.350
ID action refresh is called, we're going to

0:00:57.350,0:01:00.030
return true for now. We're going to go

0:01:00.030,0:01:04.140
over the activity and fragment life cycle methods in more detail in later

0:01:04.140,0:01:08.110
lessons, but if you want, you can read the documentation linked below for now.
