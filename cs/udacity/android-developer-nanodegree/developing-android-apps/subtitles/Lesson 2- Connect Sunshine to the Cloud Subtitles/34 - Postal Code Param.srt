Great work. Thumbs up. The data has landed safely on

0:00:03.850,0:00:07.065
our phones. But I was thinking about it, and actually

0:00:07.065,0:00:10.057
instead of hard coding our post code in, we'd really

0:00:10.057,0:00:12.515
[SOUND] like our sun train app user, to be able

0:00:12.515,0:00:15.726
to change their location in the settings. So let's make

0:00:15.726,0:00:19.183
the FetchWeatherTask more flexible by having it take as input

0:00:19.183,0:00:22.890
a postal code parameter. While we're doing that, we should

0:00:22.890,0:00:26.340
also take this opportunity to do a little bit of refactoring.

0:00:26.340,0:00:29.600
Instead of concatenating the strings for the server query

0:00:29.600,0:00:32.369
URL, we should use a UriBuilder Class to build

0:00:32.369,0:00:35.580
up he URL. We can declare a base URL

0:00:35.580,0:00:39.120
and then append each pair of query PARAM and

0:00:39.120,0:00:43.100
PARAM values onto it. This includes PARAM's for post

0:00:43.100,0:00:46.890
code. JSON format, metric units, and date count. This'll

0:00:46.890,0:00:49.080
make it easier in the future if we ever

0:00:49.080,0:00:51.610
have to make these options configurable by the user.

0:00:52.710,0:00:55.950
If you want to verify that the URL is built up properly. After

0:00:55.950,0:00:59.110
you do these tasks, you can use verbose logging to print it out.
