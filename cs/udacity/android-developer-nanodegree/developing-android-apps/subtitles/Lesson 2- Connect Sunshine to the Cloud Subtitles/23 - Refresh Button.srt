Since the fetch weather task is in the fragment, the

0:00:02.890,0:00:05.930
menu option to trigger that task should be inside the fragment

0:00:05.930,0:00:08.320
too. That means we should create a new menu layout

0:00:08.320,0:00:12.390
for the fragment and we'll call it forecastfragment.xml. The file will

0:00:12.390,0:00:15.770
live within the menu folder under the Resources directory. Inside

0:00:15.770,0:00:19.200
that file, we'll declare the new menu option for refresh and

0:00:19.200,0:00:22.140
give it this menu item ID. We'll also need to define

0:00:22.140,0:00:25.290
a string label for this word, Refresh. We're taking this one

0:00:25.290,0:00:27.440
step at a time, so just make the menu xml

0:00:27.440,0:00:30.250
file change in this exercise. If you compile and run

0:00:30.250,0:00:33.060
the app, there'll be no visible change. It won't show

0:00:33.060,0:00:35.500
up on the device yet because we haven't inflated the menu

0:00:35.500,0:00:38.270
item. Inflating it will be in the coding test after

0:00:38.270,0:00:41.550
this. See how the menu main.xml is implemented as an

0:00:41.550,0:00:44.860
example. For an additional hint, see the menu training guide

0:00:44.860,0:00:47.150
below. When you're done, you can click on this box here.
