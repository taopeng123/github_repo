As of July of 2013, one and a half

0:00:03.130,0:00:07.560
million new Android devices were being activated every day.

0:00:07.560,0:00:09.080
So it's hard to believe that just a few

0:00:09.080,0:00:13.960
years ago, I started all meetings with potential developers explaining

0:00:13.960,0:00:16.079
what Android was and convincing them that it was

0:00:16.079,0:00:19.560
worth their time and effort developing for the platform.

0:00:19.560,0:00:22.150
It wasn't until 2010 that we even shared numbers

0:00:22.150,0:00:26.080
to indicate the growth of the platform, 100,000 daily activations

0:00:26.080,0:00:28.729
in May of that year. Which quickly grew to

0:00:28.729,0:00:33.290
500,000 in mid-2011 and crossed the million daily activations mark

0:00:33.290,0:00:37.340
in 2012. That represents over a billion Android devices around

0:00:37.340,0:00:39.940
the world, which is why I don't start my presentations

0:00:39.940,0:00:42.320
asking if anyone in the room has an Android device

0:00:42.320,0:00:45.480
anymore. To me though, the biggest surprise in those early

0:00:45.480,0:00:48.610
days was how much effort was required to convince people

0:00:48.610,0:00:52.580
that developing for mobile at all was a worthwhile investment.

0:00:52.580,0:00:54.700
A huge number of people use their phones to go

0:00:54.700,0:00:56.810
online and many of them use their phone as the main

0:00:56.810,0:00:59.808
way to do so. One study by the Pew Research

0:00:59.808,0:01:04.163
Internet Project in 2013 found that nearly two-thirds of mobile owners

0:01:04.163,0:01:07.111
use their phones to go online, double the rate found

0:01:07.111,0:01:09.810
in 2009. And that a third of phone users use mostly

0:01:09.810,0:01:13.970
their phone to get online. Think about that for a second.

0:01:13.970,0:01:17.730
These portable phones have become pocket computers constantly connected to the

0:01:17.730,0:01:20.910
cloud to make the sum of human knowledge available

0:01:20.910,0:01:23.530
to us at a touch and a glance. It's no

0:01:23.530,0:01:25.870
wonder then that for a growing number of people,

0:01:25.870,0:01:28.050
mobile isn't how to get online when you're away from

0:01:28.050,0:01:31.610
your desk. It's actually displacing PCs as their primary

0:01:31.610,0:01:35.460
computing platform. The change is so dramatic and the trend

0:01:35.460,0:01:39.150
so clear that companies like Google, who depend entirely on

0:01:39.150,0:01:42.800
the internet, have a mobile first policy, ensuring that the

0:01:42.800,0:01:45.750
mobile experience is the first consideration when building

0:01:45.750,0:01:49.930
new products. This trend is particularly evident amongst younger

0:01:49.930,0:01:52.870
users who grew up using mobiles and especially

0:01:52.870,0:01:55.340
in emerging markets like Africa and Asia, where the

0:01:55.340,0:01:59.530
infrastructure to support ubiquitous broadband for desktops isn't

0:01:59.530,0:02:02.300
as readily available. I saw this firsthand when I

0:02:02.300,0:02:03.960
had the good fortune to visit Kenya a

0:02:03.960,0:02:08.380
few years ago. Ubiquitous phones and passionate, talented developers

0:02:08.380,0:02:12.300
weren't really familiar, but what really struck me was the degree

0:02:12.300,0:02:15.300
to which mobile phones had become an integral part of people's

0:02:15.300,0:02:18.940
everyday lives. It wasn't just checking email and posting to Facebook,

0:02:18.940,0:02:21.740
it was using [UNKNOWN] to buy everything from groceries to bus

0:02:21.740,0:02:25.390
fare. Mobiles was such a part of life that I heard

0:02:25.390,0:02:28.620
rather than buying someone a drink to show that you're interested,

0:02:28.620,0:02:30.440
you'd send them a phone credit so that they can call

0:02:30.440,0:02:33.420
you if they felt the same way. In the transition of

0:02:33.420,0:02:36.890
smartphones from tech accessory to a part of life to the

0:02:36.890,0:02:39.180
main way you get online to how you pay for things,

0:02:39.180,0:02:43.200
even how you flirt, represents a huge opportunity for us as

0:02:43.200,0:02:47.010
developers. The question is, how are you going to change the world?
