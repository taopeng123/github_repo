0:00:00.310,0:00:03.400
The foreign key constraint keeps[br]the link between the tables

0:00:03.400,0:00:07.630
by preventing invalid data from being[br]inserted into the foreign key column,

0:00:07.630,0:00:10.540
because the value has to be[br]one of the values contained in

0:00:10.540,0:00:12.670
the table the constraint points to.

0:00:12.670,0:00:14.750
Well, what does this mean for testing?

0:00:14.750,0:00:18.990
It means that we cannot test the weather[br]table without having the location table,

0:00:18.990,0:00:23.450
because the foreign key constraint[br]enforces that the location ID is a valid

0:00:23.450,0:00:25.650
ID in the location table.

0:00:25.650,0:00:28.630
It also means that we have to use[br]the result of an insert in the location

0:00:28.630,0:00:31.550
table in order to insert[br]in the weather table.

0:00:31.550,0:00:32.450
In other words,

0:00:32.450,0:00:36.650
the weather table cannot be unit tested[br]independently from the location table.

0:00:36.650,0:00:39.030
We are going to be writing[br]a database test for sunshine,

0:00:39.030,0:00:41.040
which will have to[br]work with a constraint.
