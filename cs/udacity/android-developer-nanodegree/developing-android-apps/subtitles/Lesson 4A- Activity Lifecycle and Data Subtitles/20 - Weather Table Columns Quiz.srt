This is a good time to revisit[br]our final detail wireframe.

0:00:04.340,0:00:07.550
If we're going to store our weather[br]forecast information in a database

0:00:07.550,0:00:10.270
table, which columns[br]should our contract have?

0:00:12.720,0:00:16.360
In our database, we will have[br]a table of weather forecast entries.

0:00:16.360,0:00:18.880
We use a row to represent[br]each forecast day.

0:00:18.880,0:00:21.520
And we'll store each piece of data[br]associated with the forecast in

0:00:21.520,0:00:22.750
a separate column.

0:00:22.750,0:00:26.345
Taking a look at our weather UX,[br]which columns would we need for

0:00:26.345,0:00:28.100
the weather database table?

0:00:28.100,0:00:30.830
Think of which columns should[br]be in each database record.
