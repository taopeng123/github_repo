For the purposes of the Sunshine app, this information is purely theoretical.

0:00:05.240,0:00:07.700
In fact, you'll really only need to consider this later,

0:00:07.700,0:00:11.940
when you're adding things like Sensor or LocationListeners. Until then,

0:00:11.940,0:00:14.530
the default components will handle much of this behavior for

0:00:14.530,0:00:18.710
you. In any case, now that you understand the lifecycle and

0:00:18.710,0:00:22.110
the way the system handles exiting your app, when it needs its resources.

0:00:22.110,0:00:26.380
You should hopefully understand why Exit or Quit buttons in Android apps serve

0:00:26.380,0:00:31.020
no practical purpose. At most, you can call finish on an activity and

0:00:31.020,0:00:35.070
it will get torn down instantly. That's actually exactly what happens when

0:00:35.070,0:00:37.290
you use a simple hits back from within their activity.

If you're still not convinced, check out the video in the instructor notes.

Where I explain my reasoning with a little more, color.
