0:00:00.250,0:00:03.661
Here's the solution for[br]the location table creation statement.

0:00:03.661,0:00:07.553
As I mentioned before,[br]we make the location setting unique.

0:00:07.553,0:00:12.204
This is particularly important because[br]the ID of the existing location is

0:00:12.204,0:00:17.700
used as a foreign key in our weather[br]table, and therefore must not change.

0:00:17.700,0:00:20.590
And this constraint will prevent[br]the same location setting

0:00:20.590,0:00:21.840
from having multiple IDs.
