0:00:00.810,0:00:02.940
Now, that you've seen[br]the WeatherEntry class for

0:00:02.940,0:00:04.560
the weather table, it's your turn.

0:00:05.810,0:00:06.860
Add the constants for

0:00:06.860,0:00:11.850
the location table in the LocationEntry[br]inner contract class.

0:00:11.850,0:00:16.200
These constants included the table name,[br]and the name of each column.

0:00:16.200,0:00:19.950
As we've shown in a few previous[br]diagrams, the columns need to store

0:00:19.950,0:00:25.010
the location setting, latitude,[br]longitude, and the city name.

0:00:25.010,0:00:27.720
After you finish coding[br]the location entry class,

0:00:27.720,0:00:30.190
make sure to look at the solution video.

0:00:30.190,0:00:33.760
You'll want to use the same constant[br]names that we use, since the code in

0:00:33.760,0:00:38.280
the other classes you received relies[br]on these constant names being the same.

0:00:38.280,0:00:39.148
Once you've finished,

0:00:39.148,0:00:43.000
you will have defined all of[br]the columns for both of the tables.

0:00:43.000,0:00:47.300
Next, we'll be ready to use these column[br]names to actually create the tables

0:00:47.300,0:00:47.850
in the database.
