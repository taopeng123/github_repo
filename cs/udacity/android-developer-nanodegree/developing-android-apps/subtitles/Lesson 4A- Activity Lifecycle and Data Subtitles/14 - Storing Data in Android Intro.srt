0:00:00.280,0:00:04.140
A key takeaway from life cycles is that[br]your application runs until Android

0:00:04.140,0:00:06.950
needs to free resources or[br]something else.

0:00:06.950,0:00:11.310
That means, it's best if we design[br]Sunshine to continue to work well even

0:00:11.310,0:00:15.600
if the operating system has to close us[br]and the app no longer has weather data.

0:00:16.630,0:00:20.250
One might ask, this is the error[br]of the connected cloud.

0:00:20.250,0:00:23.530
Why don't we just always[br]fetch the weather on demand?

0:00:23.530,0:00:26.650
Do we really need to worry about[br]saving anything on the device?

0:00:27.740,0:00:31.180
Well, first,[br]user experience is important.

0:00:31.180,0:00:34.880
When Sunshine is launched, we want our[br]users to be immediately greeted with up

0:00:34.880,0:00:39.040
to date hot off the API weather[br]information and not a blank screen.

0:00:39.040,0:00:42.850
The faster people can use an app,[br]the more it will be used.

0:00:42.850,0:00:47.150
For something like weather, people want[br]the details immediately available.

0:00:47.150,0:00:52.280
Second, using any radio is detrimental[br]to the battery life of the device,

0:00:52.280,0:00:54.640
especially the cellular radio.

0:00:54.640,0:00:57.800
Storing the weather data rather[br]than fetching it each time saves

0:00:57.800,0:00:58.920
battery life.

0:00:58.920,0:01:01.190
And that leads to happier users.

0:01:01.190,0:01:04.670
Third, there are many users[br]on metered data plans or

0:01:04.670,0:01:07.770
users may be roaming when[br]they want to use Sunshine.

0:01:07.770,0:01:11.148
All those unnecessary[br]data fetches can add up.

0:01:11.148,0:01:14.620
Fourth, if you're running a web[br]service for your application,

0:01:14.620,0:01:19.070
you'll be highly motivated to reduce[br]the server load and network bandwidth.

0:01:19.070,0:01:22.040
Fifth, there are still[br]lots of places that don't

0:01:22.040,0:01:24.820
have a network connection[br]available constantly.

0:01:24.820,0:01:28.878
One of the prime advantages of having a[br]mobile app is being resistant to bad or

0:01:28.878,0:01:31.240
non-existent network conditions.

0:01:31.240,0:01:36.690
Sixth, and finally, you never know[br]where a user will want to use your app.

0:01:36.690,0:01:41.470
Although our weather API currently[br]doesn't support outer space locations.

0:01:41.470,0:01:45.834
Being smart about the way we use system[br]resources is key to making the Sunshine

0:01:45.834,0:01:48.080
a good Android citizen.

0:01:48.080,0:01:52.321
As conscientious developers, we strive[br]to make all of our apps adhere to these

0:01:52.321,0:01:55.010
principles by minimizing[br]network activity and

0:01:55.010,0:01:59.660
working seamlessly between offline and[br]online states.

0:01:59.660,0:02:03.520
We persist data in Sunshine to make[br]it both a better experience for

0:02:03.520,0:02:07.550
users, while making it use less[br]network and battery resources.
