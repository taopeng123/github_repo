Here's an overview of the changes[br]we're going to be making to Sunshine.

0:00:03.760,0:00:07.700
We'll continue to refer to this map[br]as we move these coding exercises.

0:00:07.700,0:00:11.260
There are lots of terms in this map[br]that we haven't discussed before

0:00:11.260,0:00:15.720
such as database contract,[br]content provider, and DB Helper.

0:00:15.720,0:00:18.820
Each one of these blocks represents[br]a section of our modular

0:00:18.820,0:00:20.720
data storage solution.

0:00:20.720,0:00:24.560
We start by defining our data[br]storage in terms of a contract.

0:00:24.560,0:00:27.850
We then implement[br]the database using SQLite.

0:00:27.850,0:00:32.390
And finally, we layer a fundamental[br]Android class between our UI and

0:00:32.390,0:00:35.160
the data storage called[br]a content provider.

0:00:35.160,0:00:40.100
Ultimately, building our data storage[br]in this way allows Sunshine to leverage

0:00:40.100,0:00:42.150
powerful Android frameworks.

0:00:42.150,0:00:46.270
We'll explain all of this in more[br]detail as we implement each section.

0:00:46.270,0:00:47.010
Let's get started.
