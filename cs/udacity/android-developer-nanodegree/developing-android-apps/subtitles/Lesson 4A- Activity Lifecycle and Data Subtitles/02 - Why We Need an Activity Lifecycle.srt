0:00:00.640,0:00:01.200
Okay.

0:00:01.200,0:00:04.590
So before Dan gets carried away with databases, let's look at

0:00:04.590,0:00:08.280
what happens when you use an intent to transition between activities.

0:00:08.280,0:00:09.354
Within Sunshine,

0:00:09.354,0:00:13.387
if you tap on a list in the main activity it opens up the detail activity.

0:00:16.962,0:00:19.230
But the main activity remains on the backstack.

0:00:19.230,0:00:22.080
Ready to reappear as soon as you hit Back.

0:00:22.080,0:00:25.980
Now, in that example, both activities are within the same app.

0:00:25.980,0:00:29.264
But as we learned in lesson three, you can also watch the browser or

0:00:29.264,0:00:30.507
maps app from sunshine.

0:00:35.091,0:00:37.041
Or for that matter, the user can hit Home.

0:00:41.065,0:00:44.521
And launch apps from there, or they can use the recent key or

0:00:44.521,0:00:47.160
switch to another app using notifications.

0:00:47.160,0:00:50.270
All of these options mean you can end up with a lot of apps on your back stack.

0:00:57.947,0:01:02.440
Now, keep in mind that our resources on devices are extremely limited.

0:01:02.440,0:01:06.700
So it's not a good idea to have dozens of apps sitting idle in the background.

0:01:06.700,0:01:07.880
Android solves this for us,

0:01:07.880,0:01:11.320
so you don't have to use those awful task killer apps.

0:01:11.320,0:01:13.010
So, how does it do that?

0:01:13.010,0:01:17.120
Well, it kills low priority applications that you haven't used in a while.

0:01:17.120,0:01:20.840
We'll go into detail on exactly how it figures out which app needs to die,

0:01:20.840,0:01:21.740
in lesson six.

0:01:21.740,0:01:25.030
But for now, it's important to realize that your app isn't in

0:01:25.030,0:01:27.070
control of its own destiny.

0:01:27.070,0:01:28.612
It can be killed at any time.

0:01:32.589,0:01:34.305
So you need to know, how to deal with that.

0:01:34.305,0:01:37.846
And that means understanding the lifecycle of an activity and the signals we

0:01:37.846,0:01:41.180
get from the framework to indicate its progress through the lifetime.
