We've tested the location table so

0:00:02.990,0:00:06.760
now we should test the weather table[br]in a test weather table method.

0:00:06.760,0:00:09.600
Follow the steps to create[br]a test to Insert a row of data

0:00:09.600,0:00:11.470
into the weather database table.

0:00:11.470,0:00:15.360
Noting that we have to first insert into[br]the location table to get the location

0:00:15.360,0:00:17.010
key for the weather query.

0:00:17.010,0:00:19.370
Then query the table and[br]validate the values.
