Let's see if we can figure out what happens when an app is terminated in

0:00:03.880,0:00:08.690
the background. Start the app again then hit the Home key. Now launch some other

0:00:08.690,0:00:13.240
apps before returning to ours. Try and pick apps with large memory footprints.

0:00:13.240,0:00:17.310
Can you figure out, which of the following lifecycle event handlers is the last

0:00:17.310,0:00:21.000
one guaranteed to be called, before your app maybe terminated by the runtime?
