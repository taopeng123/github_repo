0:00:00.120,0:00:01.340
Here's our solution.

0:00:01.340,0:00:03.540
You are given the unique table name.

0:00:03.540,0:00:06.320
The rest of this inner class[br]lists the columns we're going

0:00:06.320,0:00:07.350
to use to store our data.

0:00:08.788,0:00:13.110
Once again, you'll want to use the same[br]constant names that I used in this

0:00:13.110,0:00:16.700
solution, since the code in[br]the other classes you've received,

0:00:16.700,0:00:20.790
such as the weather DBHelper,[br]uses these same constant names.
