Using SQLite makes it easy to delete,[br]update, and

0:00:04.470,0:00:08.090
insert rows,[br]using highly expressive queries.

0:00:08.090,0:00:11.230
One can even add new columns[br]as you revision your database,

0:00:11.230,0:00:13.500
while retaining existing user data.

It's not a surprise that[br]just about every popular app

0:00:16.210,0:00:19.190
makes some use of SQLite in Android.

0:00:19.190,0:00:23.000
It's a very powerful and important[br]component of the Android solution.

0:00:23.000,0:00:26.610
Android also provides a huge set of[br]helper functions to make working with

0:00:26.610,0:00:30.870
databases easy, including functions[br]to automate query building,

0:00:30.870,0:00:35.430
display list views, and[br]even utilize pre-compiled statements.

Well that's what you need to know to get[br]started with data storage on Android.

0:00:43.740,0:00:45.570
All of this is documented[br]if you search for

0:00:45.570,0:00:48.950
data storage on developer.android.com.

0:00:48.950,0:00:52.495
We'll be working with these storage[br]APIs to build our sunshine database.
