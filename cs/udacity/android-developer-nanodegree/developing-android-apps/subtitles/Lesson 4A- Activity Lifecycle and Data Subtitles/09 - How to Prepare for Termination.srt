As you are moving around between apps, you probably notice that from a user

0:00:04.400,0:00:08.670
perspective, Android doesn't announce changes in app state. It doesn't announce,

0:00:08.670,0:00:12.890
that it's low in memory or ask users to close apps, to free up resources. In

0:00:12.890,0:00:17.010
fact, it does everything it can, to make the resource limitation to the device,

0:00:17.010,0:00:21.800
invisible to the user. That means keeping the foreground app running smoothly,

0:00:21.800,0:00:25.100
and switching between apps seamless, and that means killing apps in

0:00:25.100,0:00:30.420
the background. And it does that if it

0:00:30.420,0:00:34.690
needs their resources to make sure that the foreground apps can continue to run.

0:00:34.690,0:00:38.080
So we know that as soon as your app isn't visible, its lifetime is as

0:00:38.080,0:00:41.810
perilous as that of a Stark at the Red Wedding. Likely to die without notice,

0:00:41.810,0:00:46.670
but ready to return from the dead. That tells us some very important things

0:00:46.670,0:00:50.140
about how our app should behave to be good citizens and provide a great user

0:00:50.140,0:00:54.600
experience. From a system perspective, on pause and on stop are signals that our

0:00:54.600,0:00:57.990
app may be killed eminently. So we need to clean up any resources that

0:00:57.990,0:01:01.990
need an orderly tear down such as closing any open connections or sockets.
