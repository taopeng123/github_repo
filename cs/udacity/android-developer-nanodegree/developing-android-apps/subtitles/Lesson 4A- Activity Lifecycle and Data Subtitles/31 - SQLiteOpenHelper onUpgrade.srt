Let's continue looking at our DB helper.

0:00:03.450,0:00:06.360
The other important function[br]that we are required to fill in

0:00:06.360,0:00:08.290
is the on-upgrade method.

0:00:08.290,0:00:11.740
This function gets called when the[br]database has already been created but

0:00:11.740,0:00:13.740
the version is changed.

0:00:13.740,0:00:18.110
A version change or upgrade should[br]signify that the columns, tables or

0:00:18.110,0:00:21.060
general structure[br]the database has changed.

0:00:21.060,0:00:24.744
The SQLite Open Helper knows[br]the database version has changed because

0:00:24.744,0:00:27.810
the version we passed into[br]its constructure has changed.

0:00:28.840,0:00:31.600
Make sure to always change[br]the database version

0:00:31.600,0:00:34.460
when you make changes[br]to the database tables.

0:00:34.460,0:00:37.570
You might think,[br]why would I care about this?

0:00:37.570,0:00:40.590
I'm not upgrading anything yet,[br]so why bother?

0:00:40.590,0:00:43.400
Because it's important to make sure[br]that your application won't have

0:00:43.400,0:00:45.635
errors when you make changes[br]to the database tables.

0:00:45.635,0:00:50.160
Since we are going to be using our[br]database as a cache for web data, and

0:00:50.160,0:00:53.680
not for use generated content,[br]we'll drop the tables,

0:00:53.680,0:00:54.900
which deletes all of the data.

0:00:55.910,0:00:59.450
If the data had contained information[br]that was user generated, of course,

0:00:59.450,0:01:01.130
we'd want to preserve it.

0:01:01.130,0:01:05.360
To do that, we'd likely use[br]alter table to add new columns.

0:01:05.360,0:01:06.660
See the instructor notes for

0:01:06.660,0:01:10.200
more information on alter table if you[br]are interested in how this is done.
