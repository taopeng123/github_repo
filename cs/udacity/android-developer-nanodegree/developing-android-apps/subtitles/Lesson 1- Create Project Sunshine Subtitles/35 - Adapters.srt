Given some sample data how do we populate a ListView?

0:00:03.730,0:00:07.370
Let's look at an example of some contact data and how it can be displayed in

0:00:07.370,0:00:12.140
the list. We start with our raw data of contacts which is three contacts,

0:00:12.140,0:00:16.720
as well as our profile images. Then we pass this data into the adapter so

0:00:16.720,0:00:21.730
it has a reference to it. The adapter also knows how to build a list item layout

0:00:21.730,0:00:26.500
for each of these data items. So, it could go ahead and create the layouts for

0:00:26.500,0:00:31.160
them. But we don't need to create the views yet until the ListView requests that

0:00:31.160,0:00:35.290
it needs them. For example, if you had hundreds of contacts here,

0:00:35.290,0:00:40.740
you wouldn't want hundreds of layouts sitting around that aren't being used.

0:00:40.740,0:00:42.850
Then when you bind the adapter to the ListView,

0:00:42.850,0:00:46.710
the ListView will ask how many items are actually in the data set.

0:00:46.710,0:00:50.520
And the adapter will check in the data set there's three items, so

0:00:50.520,0:00:53.960
we will return that to the ListView. Now the ListView knows that it will have to

0:00:53.960,0:00:59.395
populate itself with three list items. Now the ListView starts at position

0:00:59.395,0:01:04.170
zero and asks for the list item layout located at that position. It goes back to

0:01:04.170,0:01:09.520
the adapter and the adapter checks that at position zero, we have the contact,

0:01:09.520,0:01:15.140
Anna. The adapter knows how to create a list item layout from the contact, Anna.

0:01:15.140,0:01:20.360
So, it goes ahead and does that. And then we return it to the ListView. And now

0:01:20.360,0:01:24.027
we see that the Anna list item is located at the zeroth position in the list.

0:01:24.027,0:01:29.270
Next the ListView wants to get the item at position one, so

0:01:29.270,0:01:34.340
ask for the layout from the adapter. The adapter checks that at position one,

0:01:34.340,0:01:39.110
we have the contact Bob. The adapter knows how to create a list item layout for

0:01:39.110,0:01:43.990
Bob so it goes ahead and does that and then it returns it to the ListView. And

0:01:43.990,0:01:47.660
now we see that the list item for Bob has been successfully added

0:01:47.660,0:01:51.010
to the ListView at position one. Now, the ListView fetches its

0:01:51.010,0:01:55.740
last item because it knows that there was three list items to expect.

0:01:55.740,0:02:01.280
It fetches the last list item layout at position two by asking the adapter.

0:02:01.280,0:02:06.890
The adapter checks that at position two, we have Charlie, as well as that image.

0:02:06.890,0:02:10.810
And we know how to make a list item layout for Charlie, so we can go ahead and

0:02:10.810,0:02:15.010
do that, and return it to the ListView. And now we have the list item for

0:02:15.010,0:02:19.180
Charlie and position two in the list. And we have our complete list
