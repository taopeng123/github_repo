On the surface, creating a list of items is simple enough.

0:00:03.260,0:00:06.350
Android includes a Scroll View into which you can place any

0:00:06.350,0:00:11.740
linear layout that in turn arranges each item it contains into a vertical list.

0:00:11.740,0:00:15.550
Note the items which have fallen off the bottom off the linear layout. And

0:00:15.550,0:00:19.630
therefore aren't currently visible in that UI. The Scroll View,

0:00:19.630,0:00:22.660
as the name suggests, will let the user scroll through the contents of

0:00:22.660,0:00:26.320
the layout it contains. But there's a challenge associated with that approach on

0:00:26.320,0:00:29.160
a device with limited memory, and where touch responsiveness is

0:00:29.160,0:00:32.900
critically important. If you have 50 items in a list and

0:00:32.900,0:00:37.250
can fit 10 items on screen at any given time. What's the minimum number of

0:00:37.250,0:00:41.150
views you'd need to create in order to scroll through every item on the list?

0:00:42.200,0:00:46.090
The answer might not be immediately obvious but think about ways in which you

0:00:46.090,0:00:50.270
can be more efficient in your use of the views used to display the entire list.
