0:00:00.190,0:00:03.850
And now for the moment you've been waiting for, let's hit this green Run button.

0:00:03.850,0:00:06.800
It will prompt us to choose a device, without a physical device we

0:00:06.800,0:00:10.700
can test the app using the emulator that comes with the Android SDK.

0:00:10.700,0:00:13.640
An Android virtual device should have already been created for

0:00:13.640,0:00:16.290
you automatically when you set up Android Studio.

0:00:16.290,0:00:19.010
So you can go ahead and click OK.

0:00:19.010,0:00:20.170
While the emulator's booting up,

0:00:20.170,0:00:24.130
I want to point out that if you ever want to modify your emulator devices,

0:00:24.130,0:00:28.140
you can click on this button with the purple device and the Android, and

0:00:28.140,0:00:31.520
open up the AVD manager to manage your Android virtual devices.

0:00:31.520,0:00:34.210
It lists out your existing devices, and

0:00:34.210,0:00:36.600
you can always create another virtual device.

0:00:36.600,0:00:40.660
You can select the category of device and then a specific device.

0:00:40.660,0:00:44.530
Then you choose which platform version it should be running on.

0:00:44.530,0:00:48.010
And this is the only one that's available on this computer now.

0:00:48.010,0:00:52.830
So Lollipop is good, and we choose the Google API's target, because it

0:00:52.830,0:00:56.810
will include some Google services already pre-installed on the emulator.

0:00:56.810,0:00:57.890
You can choose Next.

0:00:57.890,0:01:02.230
There's a couple more options and settings that you can modify, for example,

0:01:02.230,0:01:06.990
if you want an SD card, or a camera you can change those here, and

0:01:06.990,0:01:10.420
then you can go ahead and click Finish, and it'll create a new AVD for you.
