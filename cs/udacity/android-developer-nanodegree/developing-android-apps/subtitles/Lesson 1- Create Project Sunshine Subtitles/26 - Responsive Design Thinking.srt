Responsive design, I know. [LAUGH] It's fun to resize your web browser and

0:00:05.080,0:00:10.210
see which sites resize gratefully and which sites remain defiantly large with

0:00:10.210,0:00:14.470
gross horizontal scroll bars. But responsive design is not just for

0:00:14.470,0:00:19.580
the web. Today, the lines between phones and tablets are disappearing. So

0:00:19.580,0:00:24.140
it's important to think about your UI will scale in our multiscreen world.

0:00:24.140,0:00:28.840
Don't be overwhelmed. Just like designing responsive layouts for the web,

0:00:28.840,0:00:33.760
build your layouts to be reasonably flexible or within a common device size.

0:00:33.760,0:00:37.000
Then you can set break points, providing alternative layouts for

0:00:37.000,0:00:41.350
those various sizes. Think about it this way,

0:00:41.350,0:00:46.730
small phone, large phone, medium tablet, and large tablet.
