Going back to what Rato said, frame layout, linear layout, and relative layout

0:00:05.680,0:00:09.790
are three of the most common layouts you will use in building out your UI.

0:00:09.790,0:00:13.860
These all descend from the view group class, designed to contain and

0:00:13.860,0:00:17.870
give order to child views. They each have their strengths and

0:00:17.870,0:00:21.080
you should always try to use this simplest layout that will get the job done.

0:00:22.160,0:00:26.240
Frame Layout is great for simple layouts when you only have one child to view,

0:00:26.240,0:00:30.560
like a list view that fills the entire content area. Linear layout is

0:00:30.560,0:00:35.640
perfect for stacking the views vertically or horizontally, one after another,

0:00:35.640,0:00:40.610
it is also the only way to break up the display proportionately. Relative layout

0:00:40.610,0:00:45.200
is powerful but a bit more complicated compared to the others. Throw a bunch of

0:00:45.200,0:00:48.490
views inside a relative layout, and then you can configure each views

0:00:48.490,0:00:53.070
position relative to parent, the relative layout, or to sibling views, tons of

0:00:53.070,0:00:57.320
possibilities. We'll explore these layouts in greater detail when we build more

0:00:57.320,0:01:02.010
complex screens. For now, let's get back to building our forecast list.
