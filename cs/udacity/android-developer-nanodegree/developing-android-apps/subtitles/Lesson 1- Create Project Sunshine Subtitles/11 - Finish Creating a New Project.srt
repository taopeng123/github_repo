Thanks for telling us about the[br]importance of proper dessert selection.

0:00:04.190,0:00:06.290
So let's choose our desserts now.

0:00:06.290,0:00:09.830
The earliest platform version that[br]our Apple support is Gingerbread.

0:00:09.830,0:00:12.860
At the current time, choosing[br]Gingerbread means we can cover over 99%

0:00:12.860,0:00:16.070
of the devices active[br]on Google Playstore.

0:00:16.070,0:00:19.690
It's also the cutoff for using Google[br]Play services for things like maps and

0:00:19.690,0:00:22.540
location and[br]the Android support library.

0:00:22.540,0:00:26.400
The support library package offers an[br]implementation of ui features that were

0:00:26.400,0:00:28.400
added in later releases of Android but

0:00:28.400,0:00:30.750
now can be used on older[br]versions of the platform.

0:00:30.750,0:00:32.040
So it's really useful.

0:00:32.040,0:00:34.825
Notice how we picked the latest[br]version of Gingerbread with API level

0:00:34.825,0:00:39.220
10 because it contains additional bug[br]fixes that API level 9 doesn't have.

0:00:39.220,0:00:41.320
The we can go ahead and click Next.

0:00:41.320,0:00:44.340
We're going to choose the template,[br]Blank Activity with Fragment.

0:00:44.340,0:00:47.580
For background context and[br]activity serves as the present layer for

0:00:47.580,0:00:51.890
our UI, and a fragment represents[br]a behavior or portion of the screen.

0:00:51.890,0:00:54.995
And now we have an option to modify[br]the names of the files that will be

0:00:54.995,0:00:56.770
auto-generated from the wizard.

0:00:56.770,0:00:59.210
The name of our activity[br]is MainActivity, and

0:00:59.210,0:01:03.720
the layout will come from activity_main,[br]which is an XML file.

0:01:03.720,0:01:07.730
In a similar fashion, the fragments[br]layout will come from fragment_main,

0:01:07.730,0:01:09.130
which is also an XML file.

0:01:09.130,0:01:13.525
I'm going to do a small change for[br]the name of the menu file to be called

0:01:13.525,0:01:18.220
main.xml because on a older version of[br]Android's tu, that was the default name.

0:01:18.220,0:01:19.640
Then we go ahead and hit Finish.

0:01:19.640,0:01:22.960
And now you should have a newly[br]created sunshine app with the files on

0:01:22.960,0:01:24.060
the left here.

0:01:24.060,0:01:26.540
By default, you may see[br]the Android view of the files,

0:01:26.540,0:01:28.510
which is a flattened version[br]of the project structure,

0:01:28.510,0:01:31.890
and it highlights the key Android[br]source files that you'll need to edit.

0:01:31.890,0:01:35.030
In this course, though, we're going to[br]be using the project view because that's

0:01:35.030,0:01:37.145
what we had in the older[br]version of Android Studio.

0:01:37.145,0:01:39.405
You can choose any view that you prefer,[br]though.

0:01:39.405,0:01:41.875
Make sure you wait for[br]the gradle build to finish.

0:01:41.875,0:01:44.895
If you have any errors, you can check[br]the guide and instructor notes below.

0:01:44.895,0:01:47.125
As a tip,[br]you can check the build.gradle file,

0:01:47.125,0:01:49.795
which is located under the App folder.

0:01:49.795,0:01:52.235
You want to make sure that[br]the compileSdkVersion and

0:01:52.235,0:01:55.975
the targetSdkVersion are both pointing[br]at the latest stable version of

0:01:55.975,0:01:57.365
the platform.

0:01:57.365,0:02:01.510
In this case, it's 21 for[br]the Android 5.0 Lollipop release.

0:02:01.510,0:02:04.720
Once it's done building, we can add a[br]custom app icon that's more fitting for

0:02:04.720,0:02:05.290
our weather app.

0:02:05.290,0:02:09.310
Right-click on the App folder and[br]click New Image Asset.

0:02:09.310,0:02:12.680
You can choose from any of[br]the clip art options or

0:02:12.680,0:02:15.980
you can use the one that we[br]provide in the download below.

0:02:15.980,0:02:19.540
Then, use a placeholder icon we[br]provide in a download below.

0:02:19.540,0:02:22.010
Now this will show up in[br]the All Apps screen, so

0:02:22.010,0:02:24.790
that clicking on this app[br]icon will launch our app.

0:02:24.790,0:02:28.280
It will also show up in the overview[br]space if sunshine is one of

0:02:28.280,0:02:29.950
your most recent tasks.

0:02:29.950,0:02:34.380
The other place you might see this app[br]icon is in the action bar of our app.

0:02:34.380,0:02:38.420
In certain videos of this course that[br]were filmed earlier on Kit Kat by

0:02:38.420,0:02:42.560
default the action bar[br]shows the app icon.

0:02:42.560,0:02:46.570
With material design on Lollipop and[br]later, the app icon doesn't show up

0:02:46.570,0:02:49.500
by default anymore, so[br]don't worry if you don't see it.

0:02:49.500,0:02:50.230
It's fine, and

0:02:50.230,0:02:53.330
we're going to be styling the action[br]bar later in lesson five, anyways.
