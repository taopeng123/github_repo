I know you're excited to run the app. And I'm going to show you how to do it

0:00:02.969,0:00:05.970
without a physical device, because we'll be using the emulator. But

0:00:05.970,0:00:09.460
first, we need to install one more component from the Android SDK Manager.

0:00:09.460,0:00:13.500
Click on this button to open up the Android SDK Manager. Scroll to the bottom of

0:00:13.500,0:00:18.030
the list to find HAXM. It stands for hardware accelerated execution manager. And

0:00:18.030,0:00:22.220
it will speed up our emulator. So go ahead and deselect the other packages, and

0:00:22.220,0:00:24.730
just install this one. Accept the license, and

0:00:24.730,0:00:27.990
then continue. We have to do one more step after this to install HAXM.

0:00:27.990,0:00:31.840
I'll show you the remaining steps on a Mac, but for the other platforms you can

0:00:31.840,0:00:35.310
check the link below. First, find Android Studio under the applications folder,

0:00:35.310,0:00:39.010
and then hit show package contents. Then, in the SDK folder,

0:00:39.010,0:00:43.690
there'll be an extras folder containing an Intel folder with the HAXM folder.

0:00:43.690,0:00:47.160
Then, we click on the DMG file, open it up and

0:00:47.160,0:00:51.160
then continue. Step through this installer, and the default values are fine.

0:00:51.160,0:00:53.620
Once installation is complete, you can close all the windows.
