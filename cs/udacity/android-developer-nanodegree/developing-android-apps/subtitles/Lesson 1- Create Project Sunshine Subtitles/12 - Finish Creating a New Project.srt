Thanks Fredo for telling us about the importance of proper dessert selection.

0:00:04.190,0:00:06.290
So let's choose our desserts now.

0:00:06.290,0:00:09.830
The earliest platform version that our Apple support is Gingerbread.

0:00:09.830,0:00:12.860
At the current time, choosing Gingerbread means we can cover over 99%

0:00:12.860,0:00:16.070
of the devices active on Google Play Store.

0:00:16.070,0:00:19.690
It's also the cutoff for using Google Play Services for things like maps and

0:00:19.690,0:00:22.540
location, and the Android support library.

0:00:22.540,0:00:26.400
The support library package offers an implementation of UI features that were

0:00:26.400,0:00:28.025
added in later releases of Android,

0:00:28.025,0:00:32.040
but now can be used on older versions of the platform, so it's really useful.

0:00:32.040,0:00:35.480
Notice that we picked the latest version of Gingerbread with API level 10,

0:00:35.480,0:00:39.220
because it contains additional bug fixes that API level 9 doesn't have.

0:00:39.220,0:00:40.567
Then we can go ahead and click Next.

0:00:44.746,0:00:47.980
We're going to choose the template Blank Activity with Fragment.

0:00:47.980,0:00:51.430
For background context, an activity serves as a presentation layer for our UI.

0:00:51.430,0:00:54.937
And the fragment represents a behavior or portion of the screen.

0:01:14.224,0:01:17.431
And now we have an option to modify the names of the files that will be

0:01:17.431,0:01:19.360
autogenerated from the wizard.

0:01:19.360,0:01:21.790
The name of our activity is MainActivity, and

0:01:21.790,0:01:26.310
the layout will come from activity_main, which is an XML file.

0:01:26.310,0:01:27.630
In a similar fashion,

0:01:27.630,0:01:32.260
the fragments layout will come from fragment_main, which is also an XML file.

0:01:32.260,0:01:33.550
I'm going to do a small change for

0:01:33.550,0:01:37.210
the name of the menu file to be called main.xml.

0:01:37.210,0:01:40.810
Because on an older version of Android Studio that was the default name.

0:01:40.810,0:01:42.220
Then we go ahead and hit Finish.

0:01:42.220,0:01:44.890
And now you should have a newly created Sunshine app

0:01:44.890,0:01:46.640
with the files on the left here.

0:01:46.640,0:01:49.130
By default you may see the Android view of the files,

0:01:49.130,0:01:51.410
which is a flattened version of the project structure, and

0:01:51.410,0:01:54.480
it highlights the key Android source files that you'll need to edit.

0:01:54.480,0:01:57.610
In this course, though, we're going to be using the project view because that's

0:01:57.610,0:01:59.710
what we had on the older version of Android Studio.

0:01:59.710,0:02:01.990
You can choose any view that you prefer, though.

0:02:01.990,0:02:04.470
Make sure you wait for the gradle build to finish.

0:02:04.470,0:02:07.480
If you have any errors, you can check the guide in instructor notes below.

0:02:07.480,0:02:10.169
As a tip, you can check the build.gradle file,

0:02:10.169,0:02:12.390
which is located under the app folder.

0:02:12.390,0:02:15.340
You want to make sure that the compile sdk version and the target

0:02:15.340,0:02:19.950
sdk version are both pointing at the latest stable version of the platform.

0:02:19.950,0:02:24.110
In this case, it's 21 for the Android 5.0 Lollipop release.

0:02:24.110,0:02:25.060
Once it's done building,

0:02:25.060,0:02:28.270
we can add a custom app icon that's more fitting for our weather app.

0:02:28.270,0:02:31.900
Right click on the app folder and click New Image Asset.

0:02:31.900,0:02:35.280
You can choose from any of the clip art options, or

0:02:35.280,0:02:38.560
you can use the one that we provide in the download below.

0:02:38.560,0:02:42.120
Then use a placeholder icon we provide in a download below.

0:02:42.120,0:02:44.600
And this will show up in the All Apps screen, so

0:02:44.600,0:02:47.380
that clicking on this App icon will launch our app.

0:02:47.380,0:02:50.870
It will also show up in the Overview space if Sunshine is one of

0:02:50.870,0:02:52.540
your most recent tasks.

0:02:52.540,0:02:56.970
The other ways you might see this app icon, is in the Action bar of our app.

0:02:56.970,0:03:00.060
In certain videos of this course that were filmed earlier,

0:03:00.060,0:03:05.165
on KitKat by default the Action bar shows the App icon.

0:03:05.165,0:03:07.270
With material design on Lollipop and

0:03:07.270,0:03:10.170
later, the app icon doesn't show up a default anymore.

0:03:10.170,0:03:12.090
So don't worry if you don't see it.

0:03:12.090,0:03:15.920
It's fine, and we're going to be styling Action bar later in lesson five anyways
