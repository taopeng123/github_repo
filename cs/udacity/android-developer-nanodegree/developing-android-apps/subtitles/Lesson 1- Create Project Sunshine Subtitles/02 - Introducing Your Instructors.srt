I'm Katherine Kwan, and I'm a developer advocate at Google. I started off by

0:00:05.340,0:00:09.000
working as an engineer on the Android apps team. I worked there for

0:00:09.000,0:00:13.740
three years on products like Google Play and Google Keep, the note taking app.

0:00:15.570,0:00:19.244
I'm continually blown away by what you can build on this platform, and

0:00:19.244,0:00:24.590
I'm particularly inspired by those apps that can truly improve people's lives.

0:00:24.590,0:00:28.470
When I meet people, they often tell me about their great app ideas. But

0:00:28.470,0:00:31.420
then they feel like they don't have the technical skills to actually build it.

0:00:31.420,0:00:35.150
And that's why I shifted over to developer relations so

0:00:35.150,0:00:40.508
I can help people like you really build something great. Throughout this course,

0:00:40.508,0:00:42.868
I'll be helping you implement your very first app.

>> My name is Dan Gauthan. I've been a developer advocate at Google for

0:00:52.170,0:00:56.580
four years and I've worn a lot of hats here. My goal is to keep us on track to

0:00:56.580,0:01:00.730
make Sunshine, something that had some resemblance to a production quality app.

0:01:00.730,0:01:04.310
I'll introduce Android design patterns and principles. Many of which are often

0:01:04.310,0:01:08.181
missed by new Android developers. You'll learn to lean on the framework,

0:01:08.181,0:01:11.565
focusing on what makes your app unique instead of reinventing the wheel.

>> I'm Rado Mya, and I've been a developer advocate at Google for five years.

0:01:22.820,0:01:27.700
I started working on Androids so long ago that back then there were no devices.

0:01:27.700,0:01:30.940
All we had to work with were an emulator, a beater SDK, and

0:01:30.940,0:01:35.790
an almost fanatical devotion to the platform. I'll be joining you from here,

0:01:35.790,0:01:39.500
my underground Android developer bunker, and my goal isn't to get you

0:01:39.500,0:01:42.993
up an running as quickly as possible. It's to teach you the context behind

0:01:42.993,0:01:47.025
the choices we'll make. And the best practices you need, to really understand

0:01:47.025,0:01:52.000
how to create great experiences specifically tailored to mobile devices. By

0:01:52.000,0:01:54.630
the time you finished this course you'll know more than just how to create yet

0:01:54.630,0:01:58.900
another app. You'll know how to build great apps that focus on the user.
