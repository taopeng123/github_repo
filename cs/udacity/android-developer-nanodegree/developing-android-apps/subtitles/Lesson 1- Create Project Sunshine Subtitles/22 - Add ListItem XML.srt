Perfect, thanks Dan. Since he's turned you into a UI expert now, where should we

0:00:04.814,0:00:09.010
define this list item layout? If you're thinking the layout folder,

0:00:09.010,0:00:13.510
under the resources directory, then you are correct. Here you can create a new

0:00:13.510,0:00:18.375
layout resource file called list item forecast. Inside that file,

0:00:18.375,0:00:23.570
define a text view as the root view, then assign it an ID list item forecast

0:00:23.570,0:00:27.870
text view. Give it a minimum height, so that the list item isn't too short for

0:00:27.870,0:00:32.150
tapping on and vertically center the text within that item. Go ahead and

0:00:32.150,0:00:34.730
try it yourself now. And check the box when you're done.
