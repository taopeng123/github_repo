0:00:00.110,0:00:01.320
Here's the solution for

0:00:01.320,0:00:06.689
binding an adapter to a ListView within the PlaceholderFragment class. First,

0:00:06.689,0:00:11.280
we find the ListView in the view hierarchy by using the findViewById call and

0:00:11.280,0:00:16.510
then, we set the adapter to it. The adapter will supply list item layouts to

0:00:16.510,0:00:22.690
the ListView based on the weekForecast data. Note that the rootView here

0:00:22.690,0:00:27.840
refers to the root view of the fragment, which we just inflated up above here.
