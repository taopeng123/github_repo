MainActivity is launched when you start the app. At the bottom of MainActivity,

0:00:05.370,0:00:09.450
we have PlaceholderFragment. PlaceholderFragment was generated by

0:00:09.450,0:00:12.060
the template we used when creating our project.

0:00:12.060,0:00:17.380
A fragment is a modular container within your activity. In later lessons,

0:00:17.380,0:00:21.380
we'll look at how to use multiple fragments in a single activity. And

0:00:21.380,0:00:26.140
we'll actually explain why, we're using them at all. But for now,

0:00:26.140,0:00:31.160
our activity contains just this one fragment. So here in PlaceholderFragment,

0:00:31.160,0:00:35.700
is where we reference our UI layout resource, called fragment main.

0:00:35.700,0:00:41.720
This XML file lives in the Resource's RES directory of our Project Folder. You

0:00:41.720,0:00:46.500
can see other kinds of resources here besides layouts, such as design assets or

0:00:46.500,0:00:52.910
drawables, or strings. When our activity runs, it creates this placeholder

0:00:52.910,0:00:57.370
fragment which then inflates the XML layout resource, converting everything in

0:00:57.370,0:01:02.376
the XML file to a hierarchy of view objects in memory. By holding CTRL or

0:01:02.376,0:01:06.652
CMD, depending on your operating system, and clicking on this reference to

0:01:06.652,0:01:12.500
fragment main. Android studio will drop us right into the visual layout editor.

0:01:12.500,0:01:17.340
Once we're inside a layout XML file, we can switch between the design tab,

0:01:17.340,0:01:21.840
where we can drag and drop new UI elements and modify the layout visually. And

0:01:21.840,0:01:26.330
the Text tab, where we can see and edit the XML that defined the layout and

0:01:26.330,0:01:31.220
UI elements. All of the views we'll talk about here ultimately extend the view

0:01:31.220,0:01:36.460
base class. The template we used gives us a relative layout, with some padding

0:01:36.460,0:01:40.720
around the edges. We'll get into layout features like padding and margins,

0:01:40.720,0:01:47.425
later. Inside our relative layout, is a single TextView that says, hello world.

0:01:47.425,0:01:51.630
EditText, is a text entry field that is an editable version of text view.

0:01:51.630,0:01:56.240
It has many options, such as whether it supports single or multi line.

0:01:56.240,0:02:00.380
There are several styled versions of editText, in the text field section of

0:02:00.380,0:02:06.210
android studio. Such as Name, E-mail, Phone, or

0:02:06.210,0:02:11.230
Postal Address. Each one sets the soft keyboard into an appropriate entry mode.

0:02:12.920,0:02:17.580
ImageView displays the image defined in its source attribute.

0:02:17.580,0:02:21.990
It has some really useful features. Like zooming and copying if the source file

0:02:21.990,0:02:26.870
is to large or has a different aspect ratio than the image view itself.

0:02:26.870,0:02:30.140
A list view is a special kind of view that contains one or

0:02:30.140,0:02:34.490
more view that are replicated to display sets of data. In this

0:02:34.490,0:02:38.860
case the single textView is used to display the weather information replicated

0:02:38.860,0:02:43.810
throughout the list. We'll get into much more detail about list view later on.
