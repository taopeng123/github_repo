0:00:00.290,0:00:05.120
And here's the solution. You create a new layout resource file. Call it list

0:00:05.120,0:00:11.030
item forecast. And the root element is a TextView. Then you just hit OK.

0:00:11.030,0:00:16.830
Now that we have the item created, we can switch to the Text pane.

0:00:16.830,0:00:20.492
Here's the solution code. We have a single TextView where the width is

0:00:20.492,0:00:24.760
match parent and the height is wrap content. We also give it a minimum height.

0:00:24.760,0:00:29.370
So the item is tappable. We use the framework preferred item height for this.

0:00:29.370,0:00:32.759
Since there'll be more vertical space now with the minimum height, we specify

0:00:32.759,0:00:37.220
gravity so that the text inside the text view will be centered vertically.

0:00:37.220,0:00:42.100
Lastly, we specify ID, which we gave you earlier. Great. Now we have a list item
