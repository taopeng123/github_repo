0:00:00.190,0:00:03.850
And now for the moment you've been waiting for, let's hit this green Run button.

0:00:03.850,0:00:06.800
It will prompt us to choose a device, without a physical device we

0:00:06.800,0:00:10.700
can test the app, using the emulator that comes with the Android SDK.

0:00:10.700,0:00:13.640
An Android virtual device, should have already been created for

0:00:13.640,0:00:16.290
you automatically when you set up Android Studio.

0:00:16.290,0:00:19.010
So you can go ahead and click Ok.

0:00:19.010,0:00:22.100
While the emulator's booting up, I want to point out that if you ever want

0:00:22.100,0:00:25.940
to modify your emulator devices, you can click on this purple button, in

0:00:25.940,0:00:30.420
the Android and open up the AVD manager, to manage your Android virtual devices.

0:00:30.420,0:00:33.110
It lists out your existing devices, and

0:00:33.110,0:00:34.720
you can always create another virtual device.

0:00:34.720,0:00:37.400
You can select the category of device.

0:00:37.400,0:00:39.560
And then, a specific device.

0:00:39.560,0:00:43.650
Then you choose which platform version it should be running on, and

0:00:43.650,0:00:46.540
this is the only one that's available on this computer now.

0:00:46.540,0:00:51.010
So Lollipop is good, and we choose the Google's API target, because it

0:00:51.010,0:00:54.560
will include some Google services already pre-installed on the emulator.

0:00:54.560,0:00:55.790
You can choose Next.

0:00:55.790,0:00:58.998
There's a couple more options and settings that you can, modify.

0:00:58.998,0:01:01.449
For example, if you want an SD card or

0:01:01.449,0:01:04.610
a camera, and then you can go ahead and click Finish.

0:01:04.610,0:01:07.370
And it will create a new AVD for you.

0:01:07.370,0:01:11.300
When it loads up, we see our Sunshine app with the words, hello world.

0:01:11.300,0:01:14.100
Keep in mind that the emulator is not just a simulator.

0:01:14.100,0:01:17.820
It's actually running the Android virtual machine, so you can test and

0:01:17.820,0:01:20.620
debug your app, on different hardware and software configurations.

0:01:20.620,0:01:24.810
You can interact with the app on the emulator using the screen or

0:01:24.810,0:01:26.290
with the navigation controls here.

0:01:26.290,0:01:31.140
You can also invoke other apps, do network calls, play audio or

0:01:31.140,0:01:33.060
video and much more.

0:01:33.060,0:01:36.590
It also includes debug capabilities, including log output.

0:01:36.590,0:01:39.420
And the ability to simulate app interrupts or network it in C.

0:01:39.420,0:01:43.240
You can also head home and browse around the device to see other apps.

0:01:44.610,0:01:47.180
For example, you can check out API demos.

0:01:47.180,0:01:49.080
Feel free to play around with the emulator some more.

0:01:50.160,0:01:54.410
If you open up Android device monitor, you can go into the emulator control tab.

0:01:54.410,0:01:55.970
There you'll see different options for

0:01:55.970,0:02:00.310
simulating behavior, on your AVD, such as for telephony and location.

0:02:00.310,0:02:05.230
Now that the Hello World app runs on the emulator,

0:02:05.230,0:02:08.030
let's see what goes on behind the scenes to make the app run.
