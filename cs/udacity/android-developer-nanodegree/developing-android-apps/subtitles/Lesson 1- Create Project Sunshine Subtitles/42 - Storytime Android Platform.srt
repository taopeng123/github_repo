I asked my first Android question on Stack Overflow, on August 25, 2008.

0:00:04.040,0:00:09.080
Was about a problem I was having on the 0.9 Android Beta SDK.

0:00:10.100,0:00:12.250
Android has evolved quickly since then, and

0:00:12.250,0:00:16.560
no where is there more power than here, in the Android Dessert Sculpture garden,

0:00:16.560,0:00:20.150
at the very heart of Android, building 44 at Google HQ.

0:00:21.180,0:00:24.580
More than just a convenient place to take a photo with a life-size sculpture of

0:00:24.580,0:00:30.400
your favorite dessert, it also tells the history of Android. In terms of food,

0:00:30.400,0:00:34.850
every Android launch has two things in common. Work from work, Bacon Sundays,

0:00:34.850,0:00:39.070
and the crunch time leading up to each launch. And a dessert themed code named

0:00:39.070,0:00:45.106
memorialized forever here, in the Android Dessert Sculpture garden.

0:00:45.106,0:00:49.447
[NOISE] Each release brings with it new hardware, APIs, and features for

0:00:49.447,0:00:53.954
developers to play with. The third major Android release, 1.5 or Cupcake,

0:00:53.954,0:00:58.162
as it was code named, brought video recording and widgets to the Android SDK,

0:00:58.162,0:01:03.580
and the first baked good to our front lawn. Android 1.6 and 2.0 brought with

0:01:03.580,0:01:08.770
them giant donuts and eclairs as well as support for different screen sizes, and

0:01:08.770,0:01:13.670
tracking multiple simultaneous touch points. The biggest challenge for

0:01:13.670,0:01:17.940
Android 2.2 was coming up with a baked dessert starting with the letter F.

0:01:17.940,0:01:19.400
A challenge we ultimately ignored,

0:01:19.400,0:01:22.900
instead introducing this giant bowl of froyo to the neighborhood.

0:01:22.900,0:01:25.125
Along with that, in cloud's device messaging to the platform.

0:01:25.125,0:01:31.320
[NOISE] That brings us to Android 2.3, and this giant life-size gingerbread man,

0:01:31.320,0:01:36.067
along with system support for barometers, gyroscopes and NFC.

0:01:36.067,0:01:40.300
Android 3.0 was the Honeycomb release. The first one targeted, specifically for

0:01:40.300,0:01:46.020
tablets and paving the way for Android 4.0. Android 4,

0:01:46.020,0:01:50.460
Ice Cream Sandwich brought phones and tablets back together. It also introduced

0:01:50.460,0:01:56.320
Android Beam, and everyone's favorite font, roboto. Android 4.1 Jelly Bean

0:01:56.320,0:02:00.240
was the first platform release to feature rich expandable notifications.

0:02:00.240,0:02:03.900
It's also the first sculpture to spontaneously combust thanks to a version one

0:02:03.900,0:02:08.120
design, that we've since patented as a solar powered pressure cooker. But

0:02:08.120,0:02:13.473
that's another story. [NOISE] Which brings us to the newest member of our team,

0:02:13.473,0:02:18.774
Android 4.4, Kit-Kat. With sensor batching, host card emulation and an API for

0:02:18.774,0:02:23.750
text messaging. So how do the dessert names get decided? Well ultimately,

0:02:23.750,0:02:27.800
the only real rule is sequential lettering. Then it's down to intense lobbying,

0:02:27.800,0:02:31.940
threats, bribery and [UNKNOWN] on the ease of spelling, cultural resonance and

0:02:31.940,0:02:36.630
statuability of each proposal. Eventually something just sort of sticks.

0:02:36.630,0:02:39.810
Even then, we can surprise ourselves. Take a look at the GIT history for

0:02:39.810,0:02:44.820
the K release, and you'll see that even KitKat wasn't always KitKat. As for

0:02:44.820,0:02:46.670
what comes next, we'll have to wait and

0:02:46.670,0:02:48.890
see what the next statue is, before we know for sure.
