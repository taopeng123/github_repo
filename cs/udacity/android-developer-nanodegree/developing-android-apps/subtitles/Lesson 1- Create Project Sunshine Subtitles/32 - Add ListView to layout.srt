You should have changed the TextView into a ListView element.

0:00:03.960,0:00:06.860
Then you can remove this text attribute because you don't need it anymore.

0:00:07.920,0:00:11.900
Now from the UX mocks, you'll remember that the list takes up the whole screen,

0:00:11.900,0:00:16.160
so we want to set the width and height to be match_parent. That will make

0:00:16.160,0:00:20.460
the ListView match the dimensions of its parent, which is this RelativeLayout.

0:00:20.460,0:00:23.895
And to find out the parent of this RelativeLayout, it's actually in this

0:00:23.895,0:00:29.530
activity_main XML file because the fragment is contained within the activity.

0:00:29.530,0:00:33.860
Within this file, we see that this view is also match_parent for height and

0:00:33.860,0:00:37.380
width. So now we can confirm that the ListView actually will take up

0:00:37.380,0:00:42.116
the full screen. Going back to the fragment_main file, we can add the id,

0:00:42.116,0:00:47.190
listview_forecast, onto the ListView. And then, since this layout only contains

0:00:47.190,0:00:51.255
one child, we can simplify the layout by changing this into a FrameLayout.
