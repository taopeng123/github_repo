With our ListView ready to go, we'll want to create some fake data to

0:00:03.850,0:00:08.778
populate it. Open up MainActivity.java and then scroll down to the bottom where

0:00:08.778,0:00:13.630
the PlaceholderFragment class is. Within the onCreateView method,

0:00:13.630,0:00:17.630
create an array list of strings to represent the weather forecast list items

0:00:17.630,0:00:21.570
shown in the wire frames. For example, the Today List item will be

0:00:21.570,0:00:25.880
represented as a string shown here. When you're done, check the box and submit.
