Now in Android studio you can hit the play button to run the app on your device.

0:00:04.730,0:00:08.230
In the device Chooser dialog. you should see your connected device.

0:00:08.230,0:00:12.280
To prevent the dialog from popping up in future times, check this box and

0:00:12.280,0:00:17.350
then hit OK to continue. Within a few moments you should see it on your phone.

On the other hand, as Raido was mentioning, you can use command line tools.

0:00:21.330,0:00:25.420
From the root folder of the project, use grade lw to build your app on Mac or

0:00:25.420,0:00:29.460
Linux. Check the link in the notes below if you're using Windows.

0:00:29.460,0:00:33.410
This first command grants execution permission to the gradlw rappers script. And

0:00:33.410,0:00:36.240
you only need to do it the first time you're trying to build from the command

0:00:36.240,0:00:42.310
line. Then you can call grade lw assemble debug. Once the build is successful,

0:00:42.310,0:00:47.225
it creates an APK file at the app/build/apk directory. You can use

0:00:47.225,0:00:52.210
adb to install the app. The -r command means that you can replace an existing

0:00:52.210,0:00:56.270
version of the app if you've already done it before. For more tips on adb,

0:00:56.270,0:01:00.860
you can see the instructor notes below. Then you can use this adb command with

0:01:00.860,0:01:06.270
the activity manager tool in order to start the main activity. And there you see

0:01:06.270,0:01:11.450
it on the device. And now we see it running in our phones. Woo hoo! Fist bump!

0:01:13.880,0:01:19.050
We're on a roll. Let's go find Dan so that we can build up the sunshine UI. Woo!
