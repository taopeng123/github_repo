In the course, we're going to build a weather app called Sunshine. The main

0:00:04.770,0:00:09.800
screen is a list of this week's forecast, with an emphasized presentation for

0:00:09.800,0:00:14.870
today's weather. With just a quick glance, I can decide if,

0:00:14.870,0:00:20.560
today is a stay inside, in code day. Or if I should code from the park,

0:00:20.560,0:00:26.256
instead. We have icons to indicate conditions, like snow,

0:00:26.256,0:00:30.790
rain, fog or sunshine. We can scroll through the list,

0:00:30.790,0:00:34.730
to see a long range forecast. With a click on one of the forecasts,

0:00:34.730,0:00:38.900
will bring up a detailed view containing the rest of the weathery goodness,

0:00:38.900,0:00:43.390
which also gives us the ability to share the weather with our friends.

0:00:43.390,0:00:48.940
We can go to Settings and change the unit of measure, as well as the location.

0:00:48.940,0:00:53.500
The app can even post system wide notifications, to let us know about weather

0:00:53.500,0:00:58.930
conditions without even entering the app. So, you might ask, why are we

0:00:58.930,0:01:03.120
building a weather app? We chose the weather app because it's a simple concept,

0:01:03.120,0:01:07.590
which touches most of the core APIs we want to teach and everyone can relate to

0:01:07.590,0:01:12.090
weather, unless you're in a bunker. By the end of the course, you'll be able

0:01:12.090,0:01:16.110
to use those APIs and concepts to build your own app for your final project.
