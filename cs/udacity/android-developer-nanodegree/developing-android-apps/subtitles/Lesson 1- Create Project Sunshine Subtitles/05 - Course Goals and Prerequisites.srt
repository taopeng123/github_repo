We're expecting you to already be familiar with object-oriented programming, and

0:00:30.939,0:00:33.649
to have experience with Java or a similar language.

0:00:33.649,0:00:37.570
Personally, I got started with Android after years of Delphi and C# development.

0:00:38.640,0:00:42.560
As engineers, we're trained to map our experiences in one language or

0:00:42.560,0:00:46.470
SDK into new ones. Looking for patterns and shortcuts we can get up to

0:00:46.470,0:00:50.750
speed as quickly as possible. But mobile, and Android in particular,

0:00:50.750,0:00:54.220
have some fundamental differences that mean some of our experience and

0:00:54.220,0:00:58.910
intuition will actually make us worse mobile engineers. We like to think of

0:00:58.910,0:01:04.459
Smartphones as computers that fit into our pockets. In a way that's true, but

0:01:04.459,0:01:08.270
the computers from the 90s, like this Powerhouse I was using nearly 20

0:01:08.270,0:01:13.660
years ago. With limited internet connectivity, low speed CPUs, and limited RAM,

0:01:13.660,0:01:17.910
on top of which, they're all running on batteries. As we go through the course,

0:01:17.910,0:01:21.320
I'll be returning to each of these key mobile challenges. Looking for

0:01:21.320,0:01:23.160
places where you're experienced on desktop or

0:01:23.160,0:01:26.420
server, or even other mobile platforms might lead you in the wrong direction.

0:01:26.420,0:01:30.790
I will also be back to tell you some stories from the early days of Android.

0:01:30.790,0:01:35.190
Stories that describe how the Android platform has evolved. And nowhere is

0:01:35.190,0:01:39.830
that more readily apparent than here, at the Android Lawn sculpture garden.

0:01:39.830,0:01:42.620
Join me here, at the very heart of Android, at the end of this lesson,

0:01:42.620,0:01:47.030
to find out how this sculpture garden of tasty treats, also tell us the story of

0:01:47.030,0:01:50.840
Android's history. For now, let's get back to building that weather app.

0:01:50.840,0:01:52.790
So, we'll cross to Dan, to take a look at some mocks.
