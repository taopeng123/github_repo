Thanks Raydo. But let's start thinking about Sunshine, meaning our app. I'm not

0:00:05.400,0:00:09.430
convinced I'm ever going to tire of the obvious puns our app name allows.

Remember, as we progress through this course and build this app together, you

0:00:13.050,0:00:16.600
should be thinking about the app you want to create. There are too many weather

0:00:16.600,0:00:20.310
apps already after all. By the end of the course, you could be ready to tackle

0:00:20.310,0:00:24.430
the final project. Using all your new Android know how to build your own app.
