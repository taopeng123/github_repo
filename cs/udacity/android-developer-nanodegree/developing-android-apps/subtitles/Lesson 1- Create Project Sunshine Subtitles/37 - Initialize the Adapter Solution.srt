When you've declared your array adapter of strings, it should look something

0:00:03.860,0:00:09.500
like this. We pass in a context, which is this fragment's parent activity,

0:00:09.500,0:00:14.010
as well as the ID of the list item layout, and the ID of the text view we

0:00:14.010,0:00:17.380
want to populate. And lastly, we pass in the forecast data.
