Loaders provide a framework to[br]perform a synchronous loading of data.

0:00:04.860,0:00:08.960
They are registered by ID with a loader[br]manager, which allows them to live

0:00:08.960,0:00:13.610
beyond the life cycle of the activity or[br]fragment they are associated with.

0:00:13.610,0:00:17.920
In addition to loading data, loaders[br]include mechanisms to monitor the source

0:00:17.920,0:00:21.400
of their data, and deliver new[br]results when the contents change.

0:00:23.180,0:00:27.050
Up till now, we've used AsyncTask[br]to load data from the internet and

0:00:27.050,0:00:28.420
Sunshine.

0:00:28.420,0:00:32.650
We typically create our AsyncTask in[br]the onCreate method of our activity.

0:00:32.650,0:00:35.905
It starts a thread which[br]begins a background task.

0:00:35.905,0:00:37.325
If we rotate the device, or

0:00:37.325,0:00:40.905
do something else that requires[br]the activity to be restarted,

0:00:40.905,0:00:43.995
we'll create another AsyncTask[br]to do the background operation.

0:00:45.075,0:00:47.855
We'll create extra network usage, or

0:00:47.855,0:00:51.060
file system usage as both[br]threads run in parallel.

0:00:51.060,0:00:55.112
And, it'll take a longer time for[br]the user to see the result of the load.

0:00:55.112,0:00:59.990
The AsyncTask Loader implements the same[br]functionality as Async Task, but

0:00:59.990,0:01:02.610
because it's a loader,[br]it's lifecycle is different.

0:01:02.610,0:01:06.510
With an Async Task Loader,[br]once we rotate the device,

0:01:06.510,0:01:09.560
the loader manager will make sure[br]that the old loader is connected to

0:01:09.560,0:01:12.518
the Async Task Loader[br]equivalent of on post execute.

0:01:12.518,0:01:14.960
The onLoadFinished function.

0:01:14.960,0:01:19.430
The loader thread keeps running in[br]the loadInBackground function, and

0:01:19.430,0:01:24.100
once it finishes the activity gets[br]notified through onLoadFinished.

0:01:24.100,0:01:27.250
CursorLoader is derived[br]from Async Task Loader but

0:01:27.250,0:01:29.620
has an additional optimization.

0:01:29.620,0:01:31.870
If the cursor has already[br]finished loading and

0:01:31.870,0:01:34.890
load in background before[br]the activity restarts,

0:01:34.890,0:01:39.080
the CursorLoader recognizes this[br]during the loader initialization.

0:01:39.080,0:01:42.655
And the cursor is immediately delivered[br]to the UI through onLoadFinished
