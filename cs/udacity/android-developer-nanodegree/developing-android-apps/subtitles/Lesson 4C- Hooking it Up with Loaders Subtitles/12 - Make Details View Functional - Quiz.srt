Okay, now for the big quiz.

0:00:03.350,0:00:06.990
Implement the details view[br]using a CursorLoader*.

0:00:06.990,0:00:10.410
We've just implemented a CursorLoader*[br]for forecast fragment, so

0:00:10.410,0:00:14.240
if you're unsure where to start,[br]start with the same steps we used for

0:00:14.240,0:00:15.840
forecast fragment.

0:00:15.840,0:00:18.430
Consider taking[br]advantage of projections.

0:00:18.430,0:00:22.510
The trickiest part of all this is[br]making sure that your sharing function

0:00:22.510,0:00:24.870
is still working when you're all done.

0:00:24.870,0:00:26.790
But don't worry too much about that.

0:00:26.790,0:00:30.880
The important thing is to[br]understand how cursor loaders work.

0:00:30.880,0:00:33.380
If you're at all confused[br]about how sharing is done,

0:00:33.380,0:00:34.370
just look at the solution.
