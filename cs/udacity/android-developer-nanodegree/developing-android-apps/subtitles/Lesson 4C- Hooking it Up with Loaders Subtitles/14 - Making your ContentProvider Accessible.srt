Its actually quite straightforward[br]to make your apps content provider

0:00:03.480,0:00:05.840
available to third party apps.

0:00:05.840,0:00:11.445
The key is to modify the export flag[br]in the manifest entry here to true.

0:00:11.445,0:00:14.931
As simple as that, any app that knows[br]the content URI can use the content

0:00:14.931,0:00:17.850
resolver to access it,[br]the same way that you do.

0:00:17.850,0:00:21.480
Now depending on the sensitivity of[br]your data, you may want to protect it

0:00:21.480,0:00:25.020
by requiring specific permissions[br]to read or write to the database.

0:00:25.020,0:00:25.770
So if you want to,

0:00:25.770,0:00:29.340
you can effectively limit access only[br]to other apps you've created, or

0:00:29.340,0:00:33.530
to third party apps which know other[br]permissions and users agree to.

0:00:33.530,0:00:35.350
Then you just need to[br]publish this contract to

0:00:35.350,0:00:37.330
interact with the content provider.

0:00:37.330,0:00:39.870
Specifically the URI and column names.

0:00:39.870,0:00:44.020
And as simple as that, you've created[br]a new API just for your data.

0:00:44.020,0:00:47.810
This is exactly the same approach used[br]by many of the native content providers,

0:00:47.810,0:00:51.390
including the context database,[br]media store, calendar and call log.
