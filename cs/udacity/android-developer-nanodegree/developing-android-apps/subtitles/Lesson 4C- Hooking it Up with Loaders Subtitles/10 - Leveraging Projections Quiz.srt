All right.[br]Now it's your turn.

0:00:02.203,0:00:06.656
Use a projection in your implementation[br]of the CursorLoader and ForecastAdapter

0:00:06.656,0:00:10.653
to make your code a bit more efficient[br]in its use of the content provider and

0:00:10.653,0:00:11.312
database.

0:00:11.312,0:00:12.955
In the ForecastAdapter,

0:00:12.955,0:00:17.870
you'll be modifying the convert[br]cursor row to UX format function.

0:00:17.870,0:00:21.819
Because our code will be making use of[br]this projection in future sessions,

0:00:21.819,0:00:24.980
we've done step one and[br]step two for you.

0:00:24.980,0:00:27.550
See the instructor notes for[br]the string array you should use for

0:00:27.550,0:00:30.620
our projection and the constants for[br]the column indices.

0:00:30.620,0:00:33.770
Note that we get more data than[br]we are using in the UI right now.
