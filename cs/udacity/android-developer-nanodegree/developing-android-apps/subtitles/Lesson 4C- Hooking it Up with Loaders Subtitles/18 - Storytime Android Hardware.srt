Of all the Android launch devices, the Nexus 1 will

0:00:03.350,0:00:06.560
always hold a special place in my heart. That's not

0:00:06.560,0:00:08.970
to take anything away from my first Android device, the

0:00:08.970,0:00:11.970
HTC G1, that launched Android into the world with its

0:00:11.970,0:00:17.420
distinctive chin and slide-out keyboard, or the HTC Magic. First

0:00:17.420,0:00:19.450
pre release android phone I got to dog food when

0:00:19.450,0:00:22.070
I joined google. And the first, the wave of devices

0:00:22.070,0:00:25.970
we gave every attendee starting at google IO in 2009.

0:00:25.970,0:00:29.180
2010 was the year android went from that's

0:00:29.180,0:00:33.650
interesting to global phenomenon. Growing from 100,000 activations a

0:00:33.650,0:00:37.410
day in May, to over 300,000 by December.

0:00:37.410,0:00:39.210
That was seriously helped by the release of the

0:00:39.210,0:00:41.950
Motorola Droid. I can still remember the offices

0:00:41.950,0:00:44.760
here in building 44 echoing with the constant refrain

0:00:44.760,0:00:48.670
of Droid as each device rebooted. The Droid was

0:00:48.670,0:00:51.120
the first of the thinner, higher res, more powerful

0:00:51.120,0:00:54.150
Android devices that have since become standard. And it

0:00:54.150,0:00:57.090
was also the device whose release on Verizon here in

0:00:57.090,0:00:59.420
the U,S. Really kicked off the flood of Android

0:00:59.420,0:01:02.570
activations. But I was a Londoner then, and the Droid

0:01:02.570,0:01:04.910
was a [UNKNOWN] only phone, so it was never

0:01:04.910,0:01:08.050
really a device I truly used. Then, there was the

0:01:08.050,0:01:12.320
Nexus One, code-named Passion. The first device I felt was

0:01:12.320,0:01:16.160
pure Android was also the phone we brought with us

0:01:16.160,0:01:19.410
on our 2010 Android Developer Labs World Tour. Me

0:01:19.410,0:01:22.200
and my colleagues travel across the world. Seven cities

0:01:22.200,0:01:25.590
in ten days. Introducing over twenty thousand developers to

0:01:25.590,0:01:29.250
Android by way of presentations and a free Nexus 1.

0:01:29.250,0:01:32.090
As a result, I made a lot of friends

0:01:32.090,0:01:35.200
across Europe and learned exactly how many boxes of phones

0:01:35.200,0:01:37.840
I can carry across snow drifts in Stockholm and

0:01:37.840,0:01:41.340
icy roads in Berlin. Since then, The Nexus S4 and

0:01:41.340,0:01:43.890
five have each improved on what it takes, to make

0:01:43.890,0:01:47.350
a great android phone. And OEMs across the world, have

0:01:47.350,0:01:51.150
created 1000s of different Android devices. Starting with the Motorola

0:01:51.150,0:01:55.080
Zoom, which led Android's official expansion into tablets, and leading the

0:01:55.080,0:01:57.960
way for the Nexus 7 and 10. But that was

0:01:57.960,0:02:00.490
just the start, Those changes paved the way for the

0:02:00.490,0:02:02.740
Android mobile [UNKNOWN] west, to grow into what could be,

0:02:02.740,0:02:06.450
the brains behind anything, from phones and tablets, to TVs, cars

0:02:06.450,0:02:10.509
and wearables, like Android wear. It's impossible to know, what comes

0:02:10.509,0:02:15.510
next. Who knows? Maybe the next Android devices, will be Androids themselves.
