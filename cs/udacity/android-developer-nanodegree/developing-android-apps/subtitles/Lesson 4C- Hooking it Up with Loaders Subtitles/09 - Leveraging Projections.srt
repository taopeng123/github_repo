0:00:00.210,0:00:05.300
Whenever we query the database, we get[br]a cursor back that contains columns.

0:00:05.300,0:00:08.550
Each column has an integer[br]index assigned to it.

0:00:08.550,0:00:11.730
Up until now,[br]we've had to call getColumnIndex for

0:00:11.730,0:00:14.180
each column in order to get this index.

0:00:14.180,0:00:16.129
But, there is a way to avoid doing that.

0:00:17.300,0:00:21.300
We can create a projection which is[br]just an array of the columns we want to

0:00:21.300,0:00:22.710
return in our cursor.

0:00:22.710,0:00:25.560
This is more efficient because we[br]are only fetching the data from

0:00:25.560,0:00:28.480
the database that we need to use and

0:00:28.480,0:00:32.290
since the database always returns[br]the columns in the order we specify,

0:00:32.290,0:00:36.030
we can rely on the indices matching[br]the order from our projection.

0:00:36.030,0:00:40.600
So we can then just use these indices[br]to get information from our cursor.

0:00:40.600,0:00:41.910
One minor note.

0:00:41.910,0:00:45.620
Since we are doing a join on our[br]weather with location queries,

0:00:45.620,0:00:50.510
we have to specify which ID we want[br]explicitly in our projection by adding

0:00:50.510,0:00:55.140
the table name followed by a dot before[br]the column name, as in this example.
