Early versions of Android[br]don't have cursor loaders.

0:00:03.760,0:00:07.960
Instead, the cursor adapter requeried[br]the database on the main UI thread,

0:00:07.960,0:00:10.650
when data from a content[br]provider changed.

0:00:10.650,0:00:14.090
This caused frame rate[br]drops in many applications.

0:00:14.090,0:00:16.280
The first answer is a definite yes.

0:00:17.620,0:00:21.220
We noted how things like async[br]tasks are bound to the UI.

0:00:21.220,0:00:23.700
So something as little[br]as an orientation change

0:00:23.700,0:00:27.160
could cause the query to complete[br]after the activity stops.

0:00:27.160,0:00:29.350
So that's another definite yes.

0:00:29.350,0:00:33.080
The cursor being tied to the activity[br]also means that the data would

0:00:33.080,0:00:37.040
generally have to be requeried[br]when the screen rotates, so

0:00:38.060,0:00:40.110
there are definitely disadvantages.
