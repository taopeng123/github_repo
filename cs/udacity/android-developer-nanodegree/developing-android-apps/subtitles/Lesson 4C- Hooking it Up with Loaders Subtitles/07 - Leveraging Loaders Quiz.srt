All right, it's your turn.

0:00:02.378,0:00:05.100
Implement a CursorLoader[br]in the forecast fragment

0:00:05.100,0:00:08.390
to load the cursor used[br]in the cursor adapter.

0:00:08.390,0:00:12.020
You want to pass zero in for the flags[br]when you create the cursor adapter as

0:00:12.020,0:00:16.270
the loader will now be responsible for[br]re-querying when data changes.

0:00:16.270,0:00:19.050
Also, it's easiest to[br]have ForcastFragment

0:00:19.050,0:00:21.060
implement the Loader Callbacks.

0:00:21.060,0:00:22.495
If after you're doing all of this,

0:00:22.495,0:00:26.440
your app still displays the weather,[br]you've probably done it right.

0:00:26.440,0:00:29.990
Make sure to check that you are using[br]the support library versions of all of

0:00:29.990,0:00:31.320
our classes.

0:00:31.320,0:00:35.210
Otherwise, you won't get[br]Android 2.3 compatibility.

0:00:35.210,0:00:38.260
I've provided the exact import[br]statements you need to use

0:00:38.260,0:00:39.750
in the instructor notes below.
