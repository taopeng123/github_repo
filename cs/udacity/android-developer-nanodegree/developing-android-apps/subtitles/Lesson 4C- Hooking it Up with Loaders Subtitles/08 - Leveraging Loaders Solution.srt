Alright, you're done.

0:00:02.029,0:00:03.370
Let's take a look at my solution.

0:00:04.780,0:00:09.160
For our first step,[br]we created a loader ID integer constant.

0:00:09.160,0:00:12.890
These just have to be unique for every[br]loader you're using in your activity.

0:00:12.890,0:00:16.465
Then we had forecast fragment[br]implement the loader manager loader

0:00:16.465,0:00:20.920
callbacks with type cursor,[br]as required by CursorLoader.

0:00:20.920,0:00:24.448
We added our three loader[br]callback functions.

0:00:24.448,0:00:28.570
For on CreateLoader we move[br]the ContentProvider query we had for

0:00:28.570,0:00:33.330
creating the cursor, and[br]use this to initialize the CursorLoader.

0:00:33.330,0:00:34.420
In odd load finish,

0:00:34.420,0:00:39.070
we swap the cursor in our[br]ForcastAdapter with our new loaded one.

0:00:39.070,0:00:44.500
In onLoader reset, we want to release[br]any resources that we might be using.

0:00:44.500,0:00:45.680
And that's it.

0:00:45.680,0:00:48.870
Let's run this, and[br]make sure it's all working correctly.

0:00:48.870,0:00:51.740
And, as you can see,[br]some fabulous weather.

0:00:52.810,0:00:56.970
This is actually using the loader, even[br]though it looks exactly like the output

0:00:56.970,0:00:59.030
from the last section that we completed.
