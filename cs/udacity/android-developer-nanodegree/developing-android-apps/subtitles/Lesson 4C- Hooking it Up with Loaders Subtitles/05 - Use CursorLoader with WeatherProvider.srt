We've spent a long time[br]building a content provider.

0:00:03.550,0:00:05.780
But, we are only using[br]it just enough for

0:00:05.780,0:00:08.590
us to test that we got[br]the content provider working.

0:00:08.590,0:00:14.020
When we query the database,[br]here's how these classes are used.

0:00:14.020,0:00:17.810
Our UI, first, builds a URI,[br]using the weathercontract.

0:00:17.810,0:00:22.080
The UI then uses this UI to call[br]a method in the Content Resolver.

0:00:22.080,0:00:25.730
Which ultimately forwards[br]the request to our WeatherProvider.

0:00:25.730,0:00:28.270
Our WeatherProvider[br]uses Weather DB Helper

0:00:28.270,0:00:30.710
to get an instance of SQLite Database.

0:00:30.710,0:00:34.290
Creating, or updating the tables[br]of our database is necessary.

0:00:34.290,0:00:38.510
We then pass the SQL query[br]to the SQLiteDatabase class,

0:00:38.510,0:00:41.840
which sends our query off[br]to our SQLite database.

0:00:41.840,0:00:44.610
Cursor Loader takes the URI, and

0:00:44.610,0:00:49.370
calls the Content Resolver on our[br]behalf, inside of an AsyncTask.

0:00:49.370,0:00:52.380
Ultimately, the cursor gets[br]returned to the Android UI,

0:00:52.380,0:00:56.760
and it will be used by a cursor adapter,[br]to populate the list view,

0:00:56.760,0:00:59.380
in Sunshine from our database cursor.

0:00:59.380,0:01:03.230
Similar to the way our array adapter[br]populated the list view from an array.

0:01:03.230,0:01:06.180
For our next task, we are going[br]to replace the array adapter,

0:01:06.180,0:01:10.025
we have currently in forecast fragment,[br]with a cursor adapter.

0:01:10.025,0:01:13.030
We'll eventually connect it to our[br]database using a cursor loader.
