0:00:00.130,0:00:03.469
Well, we're now using the sync adapter, and things are

0:00:03.469,0:00:06.040
working pretty much as before. We want the app to do

0:00:06.040,0:00:08.710
this synchronization cleverly, and we'd like to get rid of

0:00:08.710,0:00:11.780
that old Refresh menu item. Let's start by cleaning up all

0:00:11.780,0:00:14.640
the other routines we have to sync. So we certainly

0:00:14.640,0:00:19.340
don't need any of this other stuff like FetchWeatherTask, or all

0:00:19.340,0:00:22.100
this stuff we did in Sunshine service, and we'll want to clean

0:00:22.100,0:00:25.170
up the manifest accordingly. We certainly don't need either one of

0:00:25.170,0:00:28.430
these anymore. And in Preferences, we can just change

0:00:28.430,0:00:30.880
that to sync immediately. So now we're really using this

0:00:30.880,0:00:34.380
sync adapter everywhere. We have a problem though. We're not

0:00:34.380,0:00:36.800
being very smart. The user still has all sorts of

0:00:36.800,0:00:39.070
places where they see an empty list. We want to

0:00:39.070,0:00:43.422
sync more intelligently. In Android 2.2 Froyo, Android added the

0:00:43.422,0:00:47.890
ability to have sync adapter's sync periodically. We can add

0:00:47.890,0:00:50.580
a helper method to do this in our sync adapter.

0:00:50.580,0:00:53.270
The problem is, this method isn't as smart as

0:00:53.270,0:00:55.030
we'd like it to be, it still won't do all

0:00:55.030,0:00:57.800
that cool batching with exact repeating alarms that we'd

0:00:57.800,0:01:01.390
like it to. Fortunately, we've added something that does just

0:01:01.390,0:01:04.010
that, but it's not available until API level 19.

0:01:04.010,0:01:09.230
Taking advantage of flexible time to do inexact repeating arms,

0:01:09.230,0:01:12.780
let's set some nice defaults for our Sunshine sync adapter.

0:01:12.780,0:01:15.665
First we'll add these constants. To make things a little

0:01:15.665,0:01:18.120
clearer in our code let's add another function

0:01:18.120,0:01:20.540
that we'll call when a new account is created,

0:01:20.540,0:01:23.148
and here we'll set some important flags. Such as

0:01:23.148,0:01:25.309
configurePeriodicSync, the one we

0:01:25.309,0:01:29.780
just created. SetSyncAutomatically, without which

0:01:29.780,0:01:32.890
our periodic sync will not be enabled. Since we're

0:01:32.890,0:01:35.830
just starting off let's do an immediate sync, then

0:01:35.830,0:01:37.790
we can call it from a strategic place and

0:01:37.790,0:01:40.904
get sync account. Finally, we can make the interface

0:01:40.904,0:01:42.319
to the world a little bit cleaner by

0:01:42.319,0:01:46.880
adding an initializeSyncAdapter function. That's simply makes sure

0:01:46.880,0:01:49.170
that an account has been created. And now

0:01:49.170,0:01:51.620
inside of the main activity in the onCreate, we

0:01:51.620,0:01:53.140
can just make a call to that new

0:01:53.140,0:01:55.570
function. And it'll make sure that the parameters for

0:01:55.570,0:01:57.990
our sync adapter are set up correctly. Lets

0:01:57.990,0:01:59.630
see if this has any impact on our emulator.

0:02:02.090,0:02:05.040
The new version of Sunshine right from the start shows all of current

0:02:05.040,0:02:07.840
weather. For a sync with a sync

0:02:07.840,0:02:10.530
adapter to happen successfully at periodic intervals

0:02:10.530,0:02:12.038
in the background you must: have a

0:02:12.038,0:02:15.620
ContentProvider marked as syncable, enable automatic sync

0:02:15.620,0:02:18.470
for the SyncAdapter, do an initial immediate

0:02:18.470,0:02:21.120
sync, or set an interval in milliseconds.
