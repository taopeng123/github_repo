Congratulations. You now know how to build an

0:00:02.780,0:00:05.290
app that runs beautifully in the foreground, and efficiently

0:00:05.290,0:00:07.840
in the background. In this lesson, you learned how

0:00:07.840,0:00:10.930
to use services and think adapters, as well as

0:00:10.930,0:00:14.020
creating rich notifications, all ways to provide a

0:00:14.020,0:00:17.670
great user experience, even when your app isn't visible.

0:00:17.670,0:00:19.720
Join me now for the final story time, as

0:00:19.720,0:00:22.040
I take you into a possible future for Android.
