That's right. Maps isn't visible or running any

0:00:03.040,0:00:05.625
services, so it's the most likely to be killed.

G-mail is running a service, but it's not interacting

0:00:08.290,0:00:10.790
directly with the user while Google Music and the

0:00:10.790,0:00:13.870
camera app are. Of those two, the Music app

0:00:13.870,0:00:15.690
must have been in the foreground for longer than

0:00:15.690,0:00:18.980
the camera. So it's got a slightly lower priority,

0:00:18.980,0:00:21.310
though neither are in any danger of being killed.
