Now, at first glass, reducing the payload of each transfer, and

0:00:03.600,0:00:07.330
only transmitting data when it's required seems like a sound approach.

0:00:07.330,0:00:09.830
You're reducing the amount of data being transferred, so that's less

0:00:09.830,0:00:14.300
data on the network. That's less superfluous work being done storing processing

0:00:14.300,0:00:17.730
data on the device. It's basically a case of putting off

0:00:17.730,0:00:20.040
any work, until you actually know you need to do it.

0:00:20.040,0:00:22.630
But it turns out that this approach has it's drawbacks, compared

0:00:22.630,0:00:26.220
to the big cookie model of all of that work up front.

0:00:26.220,0:00:30.110
So, overall, this is a better solution. But let's take a closer look at the big

0:00:30.110,0:00:31.670
cookie model. And to do that, we really

0:00:31.670,0:00:34.360
need to understand the underlying cell radio state machine.
