0:00:00.640,0:00:05.360
I was 12 years old when I got my first modem, a 1200 baud ACE compatible. I

0:00:05.360,0:00:09.335
started getting online, not the internet online, local

0:00:09.335,0:00:12.712
BBSs. At around the same time, yuppie was supporting

0:00:12.712,0:00:15.070
the first brick-sized mobile phones as the first

0:00:15.070,0:00:18.305
GSM network started rolling out. Fast forward less than

0:00:18.305,0:00:22.470
17 years to 2007, and the iPhone launches, followed

0:00:22.470,0:00:26.140
less than a year by Android. And almost overnight,

0:00:26.140,0:00:28.190
we've come to expect the world's information in the

0:00:28.190,0:00:31.740
palm of our hands. Just six years after the first

0:00:31.740,0:00:34.680
Android phone launched, it's powering everything from phones to

0:00:34.680,0:00:37.740
tablets, watches, TVs and cars. So where do we go

0:00:37.740,0:00:41.245
next? The most obvious answer is enabling the same

0:00:41.245,0:00:44.884
handheld cloud connecting computing platform to the next 5 billion

0:00:44.884,0:00:48.680
people. As hardware becomes cheaper and more powerful, more of

0:00:48.680,0:00:52.950
the world's population will be able to get internet-connected computers.

0:00:52.950,0:00:55.100
And the smartphone is going to be what makes

0:00:55.100,0:00:58.850
it possible. To facilitate this, we're seeing new approaches

0:00:58.850,0:01:02.010
to getting online, mesh networks, white spaces, or even

0:01:02.010,0:01:06.610
Google's Project Loon. We'll hopefully soon see ubiquitous world-wide internet

0:01:06.610,0:01:10.160
connectivity become a reality. At the same time, smartphones

0:01:10.160,0:01:12.490
will start to disappear. In the same way that

0:01:12.490,0:01:14.810
we don't think of computers as computers once they

0:01:14.810,0:01:18.040
become part of our dishwashers, cars, or TVs, we'll stop

0:01:18.040,0:01:20.410
thinking of mobiles as such when they disappear into our

0:01:20.410,0:01:23.980
watches and [UNKNOWN]. We'll come to expect that anything that

0:01:23.980,0:01:26.800
can be improved through the incorporation of a wireless internet

0:01:26.800,0:01:30.820
connection will simply have one. For that to happen, we need

0:01:30.820,0:01:33.350
to find more creative ways to interact with computers than

0:01:33.350,0:01:36.570
using mouse, keyboards and touch screens. I can all ready pick

0:01:36.570,0:01:39.860
up my phone or lift my wrist, address Google, and

0:01:39.860,0:01:43.660
perform searches, send texts or email, set alarms, or take notes

0:01:43.660,0:01:46.470
without having to touch a screen or keyboard. Screen

0:01:46.470,0:01:49.970
themselves have become so sharp that pixel densities aren't

0:01:49.970,0:01:52.570
perceptible to the human eye. And the team at

0:01:52.570,0:01:55.630
Google X are building contact lenses capable of measuring blood

0:01:55.630,0:01:59.420
sugar levels. Speaking of senses, not only can I

0:01:59.420,0:02:01.590
control my phone by putting it either face up or

0:02:01.590,0:02:04.170
face down, it has a battery of sensors similar

0:02:04.170,0:02:08.530
to an [UNKNOWN] class warship. Light meters, temperature changes, barometers,

0:02:08.530,0:02:10.900
gyroscopes, all of which can be used to

0:02:10.900,0:02:15.410
replace text entry or automate processes. Wearables, cars,

0:02:15.410,0:02:18.780
and thermostats introduce even more possibilities of sensors.

0:02:18.780,0:02:20.850
Connect all of that to the cloud, and the

0:02:20.850,0:02:24.460
possibilities are endless. Future of Android isn't a

0:02:24.460,0:02:27.420
more powerful phone operating system. It is the

0:02:27.420,0:02:31.410
brains behind invisible, ubiquitous, cloud connected computing. So

0:02:31.410,0:02:33.620
the skills we learn today to build cool apps

0:02:33.620,0:02:35.810
are the same skills we'll use tomorrow

0:02:35.810,0:02:38.620
to control everything around us. We've taken

0:02:38.620,0:02:42.300
the first step into that future. I can't wait to see what you do next.
