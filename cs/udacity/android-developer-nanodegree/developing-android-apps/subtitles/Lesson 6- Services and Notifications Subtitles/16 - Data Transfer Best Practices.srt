Pulling down all the data will reduce latency and maximize the

0:00:03.250,0:00:06.520
battery efficiency. But it's unlikely the user is going to read every

0:00:06.520,0:00:10.030
article. So you'd just be wasting a lot of bandwidth. Downloading

0:00:10.030,0:00:13.270
all the articles without pictures actually doesn't improve our efficiency if

0:00:13.270,0:00:16.560
you're just downloading the front page, because you'll still need to

0:00:16.560,0:00:19.470
activate the radio to download those pictures whenever an article is

0:00:19.470,0:00:22.460
selected. The right answer is to get the headlines and the

0:00:22.460,0:00:25.360
articles linked to from that front page, 'cause they're the most likely

0:00:25.360,0:00:27.010
to be read as the user starts

0:00:27.010,0:00:29.280
browsing through the app. You can then incrementally

0:00:29.280,0:00:31.640
download more articles each time the user moves

0:00:31.640,0:00:34.460
into an area you haven't pre-fetched for yet.
