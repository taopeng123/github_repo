Alright, you're done. Let's start by adding all of

0:00:03.010,0:00:06.130
the strings we're going to need for our new preference.

0:00:06.130,0:00:10.278
Key, label, and something like true, false, and default.

0:00:10.278,0:00:14.010
Then we'll additional preference into pref general xnl, a check

0:00:14.010,0:00:17.560
box preference that uses those strings we just defined.

0:00:17.560,0:00:20.730
Let's go over to our sync adaptor. In the notify

0:00:20.730,0:00:22.820
function, we add the code to fetch the preference

0:00:22.820,0:00:25.480
and make use of it. And there we have it.

0:00:25.480,0:00:28.560
Now we won't display notifications if the user doesn't want us

0:00:28.560,0:00:30.810
to, which is a great thing for an app to do.
