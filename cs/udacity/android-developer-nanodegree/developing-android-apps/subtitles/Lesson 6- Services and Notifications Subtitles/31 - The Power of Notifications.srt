If an app updates in the background, but no one

0:00:02.710,0:00:06.060
opens it to find out, did it really happen? Notification

0:00:06.060,0:00:09.040
started off as a convenient way to notify users of

0:00:09.040,0:00:12.780
background updates. But they've grown to become a powerful standardized shortcut

0:00:12.780,0:00:15.340
to interact directly with apps in a light weight way.

0:00:15.340,0:00:19.080
Starting in Jelly Bean it was possible to expand notifications, making

0:00:19.080,0:00:22.230
them larger and containing more information. That also introduced the

0:00:22.230,0:00:25.730
concept of the rich notification, which is able to include actions

0:00:25.730,0:00:27.740
like these, to be performed on the data

0:00:27.740,0:00:31.390
included within the notification. This speeds up interaction and

0:00:31.390,0:00:35.060
helps users streamline their notification triage experience. As a

0:00:35.060,0:00:38.890
standardized UI designed specifically for conveying timely information in

0:00:38.890,0:00:42.252
limited screen space. Notifications were the obvious mechanism

0:00:42.252,0:00:44.800
to use, when Android expanded in to wearables with

0:00:44.800,0:00:48.040
Android Wear. Suddenly those rich notifications that you designed

0:00:48.040,0:00:51.240
for phones and tablets make your app wearable compatible,

0:00:51.240,0:00:54.630
for free. Don't overdo it though, there's a fine line between

0:00:54.630,0:00:57.650
useful and spammy. And it's only a couple of clicks for a

0:00:57.650,0:00:59.630
user to disable your app's notifications

0:00:59.630,0:01:01.450
permanently. So check out the instruction
