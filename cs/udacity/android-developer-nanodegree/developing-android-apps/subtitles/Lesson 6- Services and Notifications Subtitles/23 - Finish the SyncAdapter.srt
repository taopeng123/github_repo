All right, you're done.

0:00:02.760,0:00:04.640
Let's look at the solution.

0:00:04.640,0:00:10.550
Okay, we'll begin by adding a log tag[br]in to our AbstractThreadedSyncAdapter.

0:00:10.550,0:00:14.580
Since this stuff runs in the background,[br]it's helpful to have some logging.

0:00:14.580,0:00:18.590
Since we ultimately want the syncAdapter[br]to run in an unattended mode,

0:00:18.590,0:00:21.960
we pull the location query[br]from our Utility class, and

0:00:21.960,0:00:25.020
then we paste in the code from[br]our existing sunshine service.

0:00:25.020,0:00:27.030
We'll have to patch a few things up.

0:00:27.030,0:00:30.520
We'll have to call get contexts[br]to get the current context.

0:00:30.520,0:00:35.150
For example, we copy over[br]the getWeatherDataFromJson function

0:00:35.150,0:00:37.690
as well as the addLocation function.

0:00:37.690,0:00:41.210
Finally we fix updateWeather[br]to use our syncAdapter.
