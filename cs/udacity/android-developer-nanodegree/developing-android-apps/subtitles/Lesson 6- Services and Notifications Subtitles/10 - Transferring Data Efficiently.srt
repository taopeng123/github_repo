Typically when we talk about data transfer efficiency, we're talking

0:00:03.510,0:00:06.590
about limiting the amount of data being transferred. That reduces

0:00:06.590,0:00:08.990
the bandwidth and the cost and is generally a pretty

0:00:08.990,0:00:13.020
good idea. But on mobile there's an extra factor. As you

0:00:13.020,0:00:15.500
can see, it turns out that the cell radio is

0:00:15.500,0:00:18.430
one of the biggest battery drainers on the device. So making

0:00:18.430,0:00:21.840
your data transfers more efficient. Will also result in improved

0:00:21.840,0:00:25.430
battery life. Now, the basic level being more efficient means spending

0:00:25.430,0:00:29.320
less time transferring less data, reducing your payloads, and updating

0:00:29.320,0:00:31.560
less often can take you some of the way there,

0:00:31.560,0:00:34.650
but then what? Can timing make a difference? It turns

0:00:34.650,0:00:36.890
out that it can, and it's a situation I like

0:00:36.890,0:00:39.700
to think of as the cookie Droid conundrum. Do we

0:00:39.700,0:00:44.190
perform fewer downloads with larger payloads? Or do we perform

0:00:44.190,0:00:46.830
lots of small transfers just in time for when we

0:00:46.830,0:00:50.000
need them? One big cookie or lots of little cookies?

0:00:51.200,0:00:52.750
So, what do you think? Should we have

0:00:52.750,0:00:55.620
a smaller number of large downloads illustrated by

0:00:55.620,0:00:57.870
this big cookie? Or a large number of

0:00:57.870,0:01:01.880
small downloads, as illustrated by lots of little cookies.
