The SyncManager does schedule your SyncAdapter

0:00:02.487,0:00:04.720
jobs. But they don't have anything

0:00:04.720,0:00:05.600
to do with what goes over

0:00:05.600,0:00:09.400
the wire. There's no standard synchronization protocol.

0:00:09.400,0:00:12.820
And while they're to tied to AccountManager, they've nothing to do with storing

0:00:12.820,0:00:16.280
account information. However, they will auto

0:00:16.280,0:00:19.010
retry requests, if network conditions are spotty.
