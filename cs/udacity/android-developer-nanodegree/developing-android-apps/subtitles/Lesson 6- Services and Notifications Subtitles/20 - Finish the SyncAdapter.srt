All right, here's a big one. Finish

0:00:03.330,0:00:06.290
the SynchAdapter, making it fetch the weather

0:00:06.290,0:00:09.470
and store it in the database. Alter

0:00:09.470,0:00:12.740
the updateWeather function within the ForecastFragment to

0:00:12.740,0:00:17.710
start a sync with the SyncAdapter. Some things here. Pull the code from on

0:00:17.710,0:00:21.070
handle intent into our SyncAdapter. On handle

0:00:21.070,0:00:25.150
intent is inside of our Sunshine service.

0:00:25.150,0:00:27.040
The good news is that abstract threaded

0:00:27.040,0:00:29.510
sync adapter provides a background thread to

0:00:29.510,0:00:31.460
run the server fetch on, just like

0:00:31.460,0:00:35.370
intent service does. Also, just fetch the location

0:00:35.370,0:00:38.110
query from our utility class. Eventually, we

0:00:38.110,0:00:40.030
want to run syncs like this without any

0:00:40.030,0:00:42.690
involvement of the user. Finally, make the

0:00:42.690,0:00:45.810
sync adaptor run when we call Update Weather.
