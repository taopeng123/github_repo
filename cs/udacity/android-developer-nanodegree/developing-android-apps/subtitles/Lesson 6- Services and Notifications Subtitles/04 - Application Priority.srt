So now that we understand how services work,

0:00:02.455,0:00:06.630
let's review how Android determines your app's priority. App

0:00:06.630,0:00:11.320
priority is divided into three general buckets. Critical,

0:00:11.320,0:00:14.370
high, and low. Within each bucket the apps are

0:00:14.370,0:00:16.690
prioritized in a queue. With the app that's

0:00:16.690,0:00:19.300
been at the lowest priority for the longest, the

0:00:19.300,0:00:22.450
first to be executed. Critical apps are those that

0:00:22.450,0:00:25.780
are active. They're in the foreground, interacting with users.

0:00:25.780,0:00:28.200
That includes activities in the foreground and apps

0:00:28.200,0:00:32.570
running foreground services. High priority apps, include any visible

0:00:32.570,0:00:35.620
activities and any application with a running service.

0:00:35.620,0:00:38.760
While less impactful than killing a foreground app, destroying

0:00:38.760,0:00:41.720
visible activities or cancelling services running tasks like

0:00:41.720,0:00:45.410
background updates it's still going to be noticeable to users.

0:00:45.410,0:00:46.960
So, the system will only kill them in

0:00:46.960,0:00:50.520
an extreme resource crunch. Apps in the background though,

0:00:50.520,0:00:52.750
they're the red shirted ensigns of the app priority

0:00:52.750,0:00:55.550
landing party. Any background app will be killed as

0:00:55.550,0:00:59.370
needed, in a last seen, first killed order, in

0:00:59.370,0:01:02.610
order to help support the higher priority apps. I like

0:01:02.610,0:01:04.769
to think of this as the three laws of

0:01:04.769,0:01:09.250
Android resource management. Law one, Android will keep all apps

0:01:09.250,0:01:12.480
that interact with the user running smoothly. Android will

0:01:12.480,0:01:16.190
keep all apps with visible activities or running services running.

0:01:16.190,0:01:21.260
Unless doing so violates the first law. And third, Android will keep all

0:01:21.260,0:01:23.340
apps in the background running, unless this

0:01:23.340,0:01:25.990
violates the first or second laws. So

0:01:25.990,0:01:29.930
with all of that in mind, consider these four apps. What do you

0:01:29.930,0:01:33.260
think is the priority order of each of these apps, according to the system.
