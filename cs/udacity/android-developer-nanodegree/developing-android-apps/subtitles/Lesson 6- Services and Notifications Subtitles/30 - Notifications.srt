All right, you're done. There were a lot of new things that time. But, afterall,

0:00:05.160,0:00:08.530
you're becoming a seasoned Android programmer by now.

0:00:08.530,0:00:12.910
As I mentioned before, we're going to use NotificationCompat.Builder

0:00:12.910,0:00:15.310
to build our notification. It's easy to build

0:00:15.310,0:00:18.000
a nice looking notification that has our icon

0:00:18.000,0:00:21.220
representing the weather forecast, the title for our

0:00:21.220,0:00:25.390
App. And our content text, the forecast with

0:00:25.390,0:00:28.600
highs and lows. We're going to use another class

0:00:28.600,0:00:32.130
from the support library, to create a task stack builder

0:00:32.130,0:00:34.960
for our pending intent. This is a simple case

0:00:34.960,0:00:37.880
of task stack builder, because all we have is a

0:00:37.880,0:00:40.980
single item on our stack. We just add the

0:00:40.980,0:00:43.700
next intent and use it to build out pending intent

0:00:43.700,0:00:47.470
that we pass into the notification manager. Finally we call

0:00:47.470,0:00:51.150
the notification manager with the built intent from our builder,

0:00:51.150,0:00:55.480
with a notify function. One of the great things about notification manager is

0:00:55.480,0:00:58.490
it can be used from any thread even though it is displaying UI.
