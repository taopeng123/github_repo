The most important thing you have to remember is that

0:00:02.260,0:00:05.850
every time you transfer data, no matter how small, the radio

0:00:05.850,0:00:10.130
could stay powered up for nearly half a minute. So every

0:00:10.130,0:00:12.790
decision you make will be based on minimizing the number of

0:00:12.790,0:00:16.540
times that this happens. But of course there's a balance here.

0:00:16.540,0:00:19.180
You want to download all the data a user is likely

0:00:19.180,0:00:21.940
to need for the current section in a single burst over

0:00:21.940,0:00:25.520
a single connection at full capacity. But of course, you don't

0:00:25.520,0:00:29.060
just want to pull down everything wasting battery power and bandwidth

0:00:29.060,0:00:31.980
downloading data that's never going to be used. Now I could go

0:00:31.980,0:00:34.750
on for hours on this topic, but Dan's getting impatient. And

0:00:34.750,0:00:36.740
you can learn the details on how to implement each of

0:00:36.740,0:00:39.600
these best practices, including pre-fetching,

0:00:39.600,0:00:41.340
batching and bundling, burying your

0:00:41.340,0:00:44.930
update frequency, and minimizing your payloads by watching the series of

0:00:44.930,0:00:47.690
Dev Lite videos or reading the developer guides linked to in

0:00:47.690,0:00:50.670
the instructor notes below. Now before I leave it to Dan

0:00:50.670,0:00:52.910
to show you how to implement a sync adapter for

0:00:52.910,0:00:55.820
Sunshine that takes advantage of a lot of the best practices

0:00:55.820,0:00:58.940
I just described, let's consider what the best practice would be

0:00:58.940,0:01:01.570
if you were building something like a news reader app. How

0:01:01.570,0:01:05.030
much data should you download when the app is first started?

0:01:05.030,0:01:08.280
Just the front page of headlines, all the stories and images

0:01:08.280,0:01:11.960
linked to from that front page? Every story available, but none

0:01:11.960,0:01:15.830
of the images? Or every story and every image currently available?
