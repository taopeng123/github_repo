0:00:00.320,0:00:03.010
All right, you're done. Let's look at the solution.

0:00:03.010,0:00:05.090
As I said in the question, we're going to be

0:00:05.090,0:00:08.720
working inside a forecast fragment in the update weather function.

0:00:08.720,0:00:11.220
First, we're going to need to create a standard intent

0:00:11.220,0:00:14.650
for our alarm receiver. We then add our location query

0:00:14.650,0:00:17.920
as an extra. We then wrap that in a pending

0:00:17.920,0:00:21.440
intent. A pending intent is a special kind of object

0:00:21.440,0:00:25.838
that describes an intent. This allows other applications to implement

0:00:25.838,0:00:28.060
the feature of the original intent that's used to

0:00:28.060,0:00:30.880
create the pending intent. We're only going to use this

0:00:30.880,0:00:34.542
pending intent once, so I set flag one shot.

0:00:34.542,0:00:37.480
Then, we get the alarm service and set the alarm

0:00:37.480,0:00:40.900
to trigger five seconds from now. But we still

0:00:40.900,0:00:44.100
need for our alarm to do something. Back in the

0:00:44.100,0:00:46.990
Broadcast Receiver, we need to send the standard intent

0:00:46.990,0:00:51.070
to start our service, and that's it. Let's try running

0:00:51.070,0:00:53.460
the app. All right, so now we've got the

0:00:53.460,0:00:56.460
Alarm Manager getting in the way of our service. We

0:00:56.460,0:00:59.760
hit refresh. It'll take us about five more seconds

0:00:59.760,0:01:02.660
before we actually see the data now. And there we

0:01:02.660,0:01:06.930
have it. A very, very simple alarm. Even with

0:01:06.930,0:01:09.820
this updating in the background potentially, and using a service,

0:01:09.820,0:01:12.170
we could still be more efficient in our use

0:01:12.170,0:01:15.730
of phone resources. Rato can tell us more about that.
