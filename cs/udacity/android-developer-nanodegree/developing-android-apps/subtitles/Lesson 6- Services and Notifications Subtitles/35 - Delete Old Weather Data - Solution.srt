0:00:00.160,0:00:01.740
All right, you're done.

0:00:01.740,0:00:03.150
Let's look at the solution.

0:00:03.150,0:00:06.780
Inside of our sync adapter,[br]right after doing our bulk insert,

0:00:06.780,0:00:09.400
we can just call the content[br]provider with a delete,

0:00:09.400,0:00:12.690
with the date as our current[br]JulianStartDay minus 1.

0:00:12.690,0:00:16.090
This is one of the advantages[br]of using Julian days.

0:00:16.090,0:00:16.590
Done.
