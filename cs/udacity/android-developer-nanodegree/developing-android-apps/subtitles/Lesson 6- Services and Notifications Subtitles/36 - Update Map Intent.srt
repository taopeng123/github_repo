All of you detail-oriented people probably noticed that

0:00:03.530,0:00:05.640
we never actually used the coordinates we get

0:00:05.640,0:00:08.440
from the server for location, relying instead on

0:00:08.440,0:00:10.760
both the maps API, and the weather API to

0:00:10.760,0:00:14.440
do the same thing with location queries. Unfortunately,

0:00:14.440,0:00:18.680
they don't always agree. Implement maps using the coordinates

0:00:18.680,0:00:21.700
stored in the location table. You'll want to start

0:00:21.700,0:00:25.260
by moving the menu code from MainActivity to WeatherFragment.
