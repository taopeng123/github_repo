Now that we've finished build the UI for our app,

0:00:02.540,0:00:04.660
it's time to think about how it should operate when it's

0:00:04.660,0:00:08.280
not in the foreground. One of the most powerful features of

0:00:08.280,0:00:10.930
Android, is the ability for any app to run in the

0:00:10.930,0:00:15.070
background. But with great power comes great responsibility. So, you need

0:00:15.070,0:00:18.920
to be very conscious of how it's consuming resources. In this

0:00:18.920,0:00:22.820
lesson, you'll learn more about how the Android framework manages background

0:00:22.820,0:00:25.470
apps and you'll be introduced to the service class to help

0:00:25.470,0:00:28.480
make that happen. You'll also learn techniques for efficient

0:00:28.480,0:00:31.920
data transfers using sync adapters and Google Cloud messaging. And

0:00:31.920,0:00:34.520
be introduced to the notification framework to send messages

0:00:34.520,0:00:36.820
to your users when your app isn't in the foreground.
