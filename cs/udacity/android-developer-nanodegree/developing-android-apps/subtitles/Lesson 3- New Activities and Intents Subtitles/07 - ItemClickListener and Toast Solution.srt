Done already? Let me show you how it's done. As I said before, we

0:00:04.810,0:00:07.640
get the forecast by calling getItem from

0:00:07.640,0:00:10.940
the forecast adapter. And here's how we actually

0:00:10.940,0:00:14.542
display the toast. Note that the context

0:00:14.542,0:00:17.023
is actually available through getActivity in our

0:00:17.023,0:00:20.982
fragment. However, it won't do anything unless

0:00:20.982,0:00:25.450
we also show the toast. Displaying a toast

0:00:25.450,0:00:29.170
is useful to see how an Android interaction works. But this method should

0:00:29.170,0:00:33.060
really be used to start our detail activity. This is what we'll do next.
