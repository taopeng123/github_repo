Done already. Let's go to the solution. In the menu layout file for the main

0:00:05.689,0:00:10.540
activity, called main.xml, we add another menu item

0:00:10.540,0:00:12.740
that will always be in the overflow menu.

0:00:14.010,0:00:20.280
We also define the string in the strings.xml file. The menu will be inflated in

0:00:20.280,0:00:22.770
the main activity class, so we can handle

0:00:22.770,0:00:25.550
the map menu item being inflated. By calling

0:00:25.550,0:00:28.230
helper method called open preferred location in

0:00:28.230,0:00:31.650
map. The helper method reads the users

0:00:31.650,0:00:35.650
preferred location from shared preferences. Then we

0:00:35.650,0:00:39.240
create a view intent, indicating it's location

0:00:39.240,0:00:44.460
in the data URI. The format of the data URI was from the documentation

0:00:44.460,0:00:49.150
page on common intents. Where you can append a postal code as a query parameter.

0:00:50.490,0:00:54.479
Finally, we start an activity with [SOUND] this intent. Note

0:00:54.479,0:00:58.560
that we only start the activity, if the activity resolves successfully.
