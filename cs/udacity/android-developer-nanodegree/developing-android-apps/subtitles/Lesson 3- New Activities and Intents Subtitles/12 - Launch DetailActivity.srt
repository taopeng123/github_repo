Thanks, Rado. Now that you understand what

0:00:04.190,0:00:06.960
intents are in glorious metaphor, let's use them

0:00:06.960,0:00:10.370
to do something useful. We'll replace the toast,

0:00:10.370,0:00:12.660
with an intent to launch the detail activity.

0:00:14.940,0:00:18.830
You'll need to pass in weather forecast data for the detail activity to

0:00:18.830,0:00:22.230
display. For more information, see the intent

0:00:22.230,0:00:24.760
extra constants defined in the intent class.
