Hey Dan, we finished the settings. Do you want to check it out?

0:00:04.140,0:00:05.120
>> Oh, great.

0:00:05.120,0:00:07.180
>> Wait. What's with all this stuff right here?

0:00:07.180,0:00:10.790
>> I'm glad you asked. All this stuff will help me demonstrate the

0:00:10.790,0:00:13.150
power of implicit intents. Leveraging other

0:00:13.150,0:00:15.080
apps to get functionality for your app

0:00:15.080,0:00:20.330
for fee. For example, why would you write a bar code scanning app,

0:00:20.330,0:00:23.282
when you can just launch an intent to do it for you. [SOUND].

0:00:23.282,0:00:25.748
>> Or a camera app, where you can just launch

0:00:25.748,0:00:29.839
an intent to fire a photo. [SOUND] And of course, it would make no sense to

0:00:29.839,0:00:34.181
write a phone app just to dial a phone number, you would just call the intent.

0:00:34.181,0:00:36.124
>> Wait, I need that.

0:00:36.124,0:00:40.280
>> In other words, don't reinvent the wheel. Lazy programmers make fewer

0:00:40.280,0:00:42.620
mistakes. Now, let's go implement an

0:00:42.620,0:00:47.450
implicit intent. Raydo? Dan's being implicit again.
