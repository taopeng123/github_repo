We start by right-clicking on our package name to create the new activity from

0:00:04.070,0:00:07.620
the Blank Activity with Fragment template. So

0:00:07.620,0:00:11.950
for name, we use DetailActivity, and again, the

0:00:11.950,0:00:17.930
hierarchical parent of this class is going to be our main activity. So as you

0:00:17.930,0:00:19.840
can see, we now have a new

0:00:19.840,0:00:25.380
DetailActivity along with the XML for activity_detail and

0:00:25.380,0:00:29.070
a fragment associated with that activity. Great! You're

0:00:29.070,0:00:32.240
done. But we still aren't launching our new activity.
