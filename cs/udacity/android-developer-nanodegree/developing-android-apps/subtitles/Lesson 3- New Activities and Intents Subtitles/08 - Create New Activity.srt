You're going to use Android Studio to create the

0:00:03.180,0:00:07.140
detail activity from the blank activity with fragment template.

0:00:07.140,0:00:09.980
The template asks for the hierarchical parent of detail

0:00:09.980,0:00:13.680
activity, which defines the up button noted by the

0:00:13.680,0:00:18.320
app icon, and a left pointing carrot here. But

0:00:18.320,0:00:20.910
what does up mean? If you mapped out a

0:00:20.910,0:00:23.630
hierarchy of all screens in the sunshine app, the

0:00:23.630,0:00:26.150
root of the tree would be the main activity, and

0:00:26.150,0:00:29.260
it's child would be the detail activity. So, the

0:00:29.260,0:00:32.960
app goes to the main activity. While the back button

0:00:32.960,0:00:35.530
can achieve the same effect, it can also bring

0:00:35.530,0:00:37.920
you back home or to another app, depending on your

0:00:37.920,0:00:41.440
history of screens. Up will always navigate you within

0:00:41.440,0:00:44.290
the same app to the parent, regardless of how you

0:00:44.290,0:00:49.050
arrived at this screen. Create the detail activity now,

0:00:49.050,0:00:51.220
and look at how the activity is declared in the

0:00:51.220,0:00:52.470
Android manifest file.
