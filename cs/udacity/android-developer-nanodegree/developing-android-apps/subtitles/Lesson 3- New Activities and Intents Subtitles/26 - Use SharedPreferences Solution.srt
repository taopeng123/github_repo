Within the forecast fragment class, when the refresh menu item is selected,

0:00:04.600,0:00:09.312
we read from SharedPreferences. Since they are key-value pairs, we get their

0:00:09.312,0:00:14.000
value stored for the location key. If there's no value stored then we fall back

0:00:14.000,0:00:18.930
to the default location. Then we pass the location into the fetch weather task.
