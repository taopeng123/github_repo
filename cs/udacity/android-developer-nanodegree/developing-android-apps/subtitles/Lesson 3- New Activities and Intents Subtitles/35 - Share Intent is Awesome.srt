One of the most used implicit intents

0:00:03.070,0:00:05.490
in Android is the share intent. It's [LAUGH]

0:00:05.490,0:00:07.560
awesome. It's a great way to waste time

0:00:07.560,0:00:11.356
for both you and your friends. [SOUND] [LAUGH].

>> Dan!

0:00:12.720,0:00:15.780
>> You can leverage your favorite apps to share photos, texts,

0:00:15.780,0:00:18.910
videos and general links. And the best part is you don't have

0:00:18.910,0:00:21.990
to even know what the user's favorite apps are. Just tell

0:00:21.990,0:00:25.840
Android what data you want to share and it shows your users

0:00:25.840,0:00:28.050
a list of apps that will share it. Apps that

0:00:28.050,0:00:30.680
may not have existed when you app was written. To

0:00:30.680,0:00:33.660
make it even easier to share Android 4.0 added the

0:00:33.660,0:00:37.070
share action provider and we have it for previous releases of

0:00:37.070,0:00:40.270
Android as part of a support library. It operates using

0:00:40.270,0:00:44.890
the action send intent. If we use Raytoe's glorious envelope metaphor,

0:00:44.890,0:00:47.510
it would be addressed to anyone who could perform action

0:00:47.510,0:00:51.490
send. The data descend would be included with it as extras

0:00:51.490,0:00:55.060
either as text, or URI to the binary data. And

0:00:55.060,0:00:57.600
the MIME type would indicate what the URI points to.

0:01:01.220,0:01:03.470
Here's what the share action provider will bring to

0:01:03.470,0:01:06.850
our app: the glorious wire frame. There will be

0:01:06.850,0:01:09.270
an additional icon in the action bar which will

0:01:09.270,0:01:11.980
drop down a menu when clicked to reveal potential

0:01:11.980,0:01:15.150
share actions. Another icon will be added to the

0:01:15.150,0:01:17.640
right of this one that contains the last application

0:01:17.640,0:01:22.450
shared to. Add a ShareActionProvider to the fragment within

0:01:22.450,0:01:27.000
DetailActivity. It will share weather in the following format.

0:01:27.000,0:01:32.844
Yes, it's just the string we passed into the view plus #SunshineApp.
