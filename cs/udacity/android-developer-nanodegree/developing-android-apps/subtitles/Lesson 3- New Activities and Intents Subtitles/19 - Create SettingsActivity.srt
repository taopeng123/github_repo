We'll take advantage of what the framework offers in order to build our

0:00:02.990,0:00:06.890
SettingsActivity. Since we're supporting Gingerbread devices,

0:00:06.890,0:00:10.628
we'll use a preference activity class. If you're targeting Honeycomber later,

0:00:10.628,0:00:13.220
you'll want to use the PreferenceFragment class.

0:00:13.220,0:00:16.480
Create a new SettingsActivity class from the gist provided below.

0:00:17.550,0:00:23.000
Update the AndroidManifest to declare this new activity. You can see the way

0:00:23.000,0:00:27.390
detail activity is declared as an example. If you see that APIs are deprecated,

0:00:27.390,0:00:31.600
that's okay. That's a side effect of using PreferenceActivity, in order

0:00:31.600,0:00:36.980
to target Gingerbread devices. When you create your app for your final project,

0:00:36.980,0:00:41.460
you can use the wizard in Android Studio to create a new SettingsActivity.

0:00:41.460,0:00:44.830
The code the wizard provides will make your app backward compatible,

0:00:44.830,0:00:49.040
by using a combination of preference activity and PreferenceFragment.

0:00:49.040,0:00:53.280
Our gist is meant to be a simplified version of that for learning purposes. So

0:00:53.280,0:00:56.970
later, you'd be able to understand better what the wizard is doing.

0:00:56.970,0:00:58.350
Check these items off when you're done.
