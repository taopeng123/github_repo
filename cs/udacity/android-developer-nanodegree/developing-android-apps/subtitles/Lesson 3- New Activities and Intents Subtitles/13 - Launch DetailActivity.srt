The solution is to lauch an explicit intent to

0:00:03.360,0:00:07.750
the Detail Activity Class. We'll go to On Create View,

0:00:07.750,0:00:10.610
where our On Item click listener is defined. To

0:00:10.610,0:00:13.460
pass in the Weather Forecast information, we can use an

0:00:13.460,0:00:16.000
intent extra, which is a key value pair in

0:00:16.000,0:00:20.090
the Intent. We use the key name, Intent.extratext, but we

0:00:20.090,0:00:22.800
can use any string for the key. As long as

0:00:22.800,0:00:26.110
we use the same key when reading the information out.

0:00:26.110,0:00:29.150
Just as in the toast, we obtain the forecast

0:00:29.150,0:00:31.850
data from the current list item, by calling get

0:00:31.850,0:00:34.600
item on the adapter at the given position. Once

0:00:34.600,0:00:37.320
we've added the intent, we just start the activity.
