To move from one activity. In this case,

0:00:03.240,0:00:06.210
the MainActivity in our sunshine app, to another, here

0:00:06.210,0:00:11.300
the DetailActivity, we call StartActivity. But note that when

0:00:11.300,0:00:14.490
using the StartActivity method, rather than specifying the class

0:00:14.490,0:00:16.900
name of the activity to start directly, that

0:00:16.900,0:00:20.590
class name is packaged explicitly within an intent. The

0:00:20.590,0:00:22.990
basic premise is simple. Whenever you need your app

0:00:22.990,0:00:25.950
components to communicate with each other, or the system,

0:00:25.950,0:00:27.420
you use intents to identify the

0:00:27.420,0:00:30.950
target destination. Starting activities within your

0:00:30.950,0:00:32.912
app is the simplest example. [SOUND]

0:00:32.912,0:00:38.050
With your intent explicitly indicating the target

0:00:38.050,0:00:44.136
using the context and a class name of the activity. Intents that use the

0:00:44.136,0:00:48.090
name of the component you're targeting directly, are known as explicit intents.
