Hey, Dan. want to see our weather app, so far, that we've been building?

0:00:05.800,0:00:09.400
>> Pretty cool. But I want something more.

0:00:09.400,0:00:11.250
>> Well, we're not done yet. We just started

0:00:11.250,0:00:14.090
two lessons ago. Give us a break. But fair

0:00:14.090,0:00:16.750
enough, there's still a bunch more work left to

0:00:16.750,0:00:18.780
do. What do you think we should do next?

0:00:18.780,0:00:21.130
>> Well for starters, let's make the list

0:00:21.130,0:00:22.300
item do something when you click on it.

0:00:23.480,0:00:25.952
>> Well, since you seem to be the expert on clicking on

0:00:25.952,0:00:30.130
list items, why don't you do it? I'm going to go eat some jellybeans.

0:00:30.130,0:00:32.659
>> I think Catherine was mocking me there.

0:00:32.659,0:00:34.910
Speaking of mocks, let's go do some UI.
