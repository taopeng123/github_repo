From the mocks, we can see when a list item is clicked we should

0:00:04.330,0:00:08.720
perform an action to open up the details page for the forecast. How do

0:00:08.720,0:00:11.870
we implement the click listener behavior? Take

0:00:11.870,0:00:14.740
a look at the ListView documentation. What

0:00:14.740,0:00:18.250
method is used to wire up behavior on a list item when it is clicked?
