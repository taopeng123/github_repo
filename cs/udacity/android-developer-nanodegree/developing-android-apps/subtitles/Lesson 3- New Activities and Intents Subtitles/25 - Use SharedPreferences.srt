Once the user's location preference has been stored. When do

0:00:02.969,0:00:06.340
we make use of it? We need the preferred location on

0:00:06.340,0:00:10.380
we query the weather service. Luckily, in lesson 2, we

0:00:10.380,0:00:14.390
modified fetch weather task to accept a location parameter. We hard

0:00:14.390,0:00:16.550
coded it to be the Mountain View zip code. But

0:00:16.550,0:00:19.960
now we should use the location stored in shared preferences. We

0:00:19.960,0:00:22.570
haven't explicitly shown you how to do this. So you might

0:00:22.570,0:00:25.210
need to do some digging around. On the Ander developer site

0:00:25.210,0:00:27.550
to figure out how to do it. Once

0:00:27.550,0:00:29.790
you've made the change, check the box to continue.
