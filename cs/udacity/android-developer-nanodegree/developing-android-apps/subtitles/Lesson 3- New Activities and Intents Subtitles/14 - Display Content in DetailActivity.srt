Once the Detail Activity is launched, it shows Hello World. Instead,

0:00:04.650,0:00:08.670
we want to read the forecast data from the Intent, and display

0:00:08.670,0:00:12.171
it. Make the appropriate changes in the app, so it matches

0:00:12.171,0:00:16.500
the mocks. Then, verify the behavior by compiling and running the app.
