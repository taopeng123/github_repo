You could register a listener for the action power connected

0:00:03.220,0:00:06.630
event and you should do that within your manifest. That

0:00:06.630,0:00:08.420
way, it can be called to start your app once

0:00:08.420,0:00:11.190
the device is getting charged, even if it's been terminated since

0:00:11.190,0:00:13.200
the last time you were using it. You can use

0:00:13.200,0:00:15.830
a similar approach to delay trying to send data until the

0:00:15.830,0:00:19.270
device has internet connectivity. Would it change behavior of the

0:00:19.270,0:00:21.950
user experience when you're connected to a car or desk dock?
