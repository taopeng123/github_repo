First, we create our settings activity, and this is the code that we got

0:00:03.460,0:00:07.870
from the gist. Then, in the Android Manifest, we declare the settings activity.

0:00:07.870,0:00:11.520
We give it an activity named Settings, which is declared in the Strings file.

0:00:13.080,0:00:17.080
We also declare the main activity as the parent activity. That way,

0:00:17.080,0:00:19.340
when you hit the up button in the settings activity,

0:00:19.340,0:00:21.670
it will return back to the main activity.
