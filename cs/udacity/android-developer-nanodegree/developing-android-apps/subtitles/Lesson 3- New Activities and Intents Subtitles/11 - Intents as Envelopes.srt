I like to think of intents as envelopes

0:00:04.920,0:00:08.109
each one includes who, or in this case, which component you want it

0:00:08.109,0:00:11.290
delivered to. And there's room for a small amount of data to be delivered,

0:00:13.360,0:00:14.409
packaged as extras.

0:00:16.870,0:00:19.000
Primitive tuples that will be available to the application

0:00:19.000,0:00:23.550
component that ultimately receives and opens this intent. So an

0:00:23.550,0:00:26.910
explicit intent, explicitly specifies the name of the recipient, as

0:00:26.910,0:00:29.900
you can see on this envelope. Implicit intents are a

0:00:29.900,0:00:33.800
lot more interesting. Here, we don't specify the name of

0:00:33.800,0:00:36.550
the class. We don't even know what it is. So,

0:00:36.550,0:00:39.500
how do we indicate which activity to launch? Well, you

0:00:39.500,0:00:42.230
know those stories you sometimes hear about letters with fake

0:00:42.230,0:00:47.890
addresses like these that somehow still find their way to the intended

0:00:47.890,0:00:52.410
recipient? Well the intent resolution system on Android, works the same way.

0:00:54.660,0:00:56.940
Finding an activity, capable of performing an action

0:00:56.940,0:01:00.920
you specify on the associated data. So, rather than

0:01:00.920,0:01:03.420
specifying the name of a class, you indicate

0:01:03.420,0:01:05.930
an action you'd like an activity to perform, and

0:01:05.930,0:01:09.000
on what data that action should be performed.

0:01:09.000,0:01:13.210
Like this, where we want to address an activity

0:01:13.210,0:01:16.450
that's capable of viewing a website. And because intents

0:01:16.450,0:01:20.200
can cross through application boundaries, the activity that started,

0:01:20.200,0:01:22.900
may not be part of your app. So,

0:01:22.900,0:01:27.270
you can include functionality like this, browsing websites or

0:01:29.480,0:01:35.750
making phone calls or choosing a contact from your address book. All

0:01:35.750,0:01:39.150
from within your app, without you having to implement any of it yourself.

0:01:41.160,0:01:42.520
You don't even need to know about the app

0:01:42.520,0:01:45.530
that will ultimately service your request. You can find

0:01:45.530,0:01:47.850
details of some of the intents supported by native

0:01:47.850,0:01:50.970
apps in Common Intents page of the Android developer site.
