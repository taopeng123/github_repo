We've talked about using intents within Sunshine to start activities and send

0:00:04.098,0:00:07.390
data between apps. But what if you want to broadcast a message to

0:00:07.390,0:00:11.630
many apps? For example, the system will broadcast a message, saying that the

0:00:11.630,0:00:16.180
device is charging or that it's just finished rebooting. To do that ourselves,

0:00:19.780,0:00:24.350
we use the SendBroadcast method to broadcast an intent. And those broadcasts

0:00:24.350,0:00:26.900
are received by broadcast receivers, typically

0:00:26.900,0:00:30.430
referred to as simply, receivers. Using intent

0:00:30.430,0:00:34.010
filters, like the ones we saw earlier, they indicate which broadcast they're

0:00:34.010,0:00:37.960
interested in. So if we return to our envelope metaphor from earlier, in

0:00:41.070,0:00:43.080
the case of a broadcast intent, your

0:00:43.080,0:00:47.140
envelope is basically addressed to any broadcast receiver

0:00:47.140,0:00:49.170
that's interested in knowing that this event has

0:00:49.170,0:00:51.940
happened. And it does that using intent filter.

0:00:56.490,0:00:59.670
So intents, which are broadcast, are transmitted to every

0:00:59.670,0:01:01.980
app with a broadcast receiver that has an intent

0:01:01.980,0:01:05.349
filter telling the system your ideas are intriguing to

0:01:05.349,0:01:08.341
me and I wish to subscribe to end user.
