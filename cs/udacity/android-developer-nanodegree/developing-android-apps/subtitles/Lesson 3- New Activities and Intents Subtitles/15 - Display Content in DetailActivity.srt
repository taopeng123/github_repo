In the fragment detailed layout, a text view

0:00:03.660,0:00:06.160
is already defined. We have to assign it an

0:00:06.160,0:00:09.200
ID so that within the detail fragment of detail

0:00:09.200,0:00:12.120
activity we can use find view by ID to

0:00:12.120,0:00:15.180
find the text view. To determine the forecast

0:00:15.180,0:00:18.150
info that the text view should display. We can

0:00:18.150,0:00:20.770
access the intent that the detail activity was launched

0:00:20.770,0:00:25.255
by. We're going to use this inside of onCreateView.

0:00:25.255,0:00:30.565
[SOUND] Since we added an intent extra with the forecast

0:00:30.565,0:00:35.461
data there. We can read that intent extra back to display in the text

0:00:35.461,0:00:39.289
view, as you can see we pulled the forecast string from the

0:00:39.289,0:00:43.840
intent find our rootView and then set the text to that forecast string
