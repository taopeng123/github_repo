If you've pondered it carefully and you've decided you really want this to

0:00:07.000,0:00:11.290
be a setting, this is what you do next. Android provides a way to display

0:00:11.290,0:00:16.450
a hierarchy of preferences, including headers, such as the ones shown here.

0:00:16.450,0:00:20.210
The value of the preference is called the preference summary, and that's seen

0:00:20.210,0:00:25.740
here. It looks almost like the subtitle text. The preference also provides UI.

0:00:25.740,0:00:30.330
To allow users to modify that setting. You just need to supply the strings, but

0:00:30.330,0:00:33.470
you don't have to implement the UI like the spinner here.

0:00:33.470,0:00:36.770
Common preference types are the check box preference, list preference,

0:00:36.770,0:00:40.460
edit text preference. We can see some examples in the settings app under

0:00:40.460,0:00:44.670
developer options. Here's a bunch of preferences. This is an example of

0:00:44.670,0:00:49.380
a check box preference. This is an example of a list preference where you

0:00:49.380,0:00:54.570
have different radio button options here. Once the user changes the setting,

0:00:54.570,0:00:58.890
it gets saved in the default share preferences file. This stores a bunch of key

0:00:58.890,0:01:04.390
value pairs of primitive data. An example integer preference could be how many

0:01:04.390,0:01:08.550
days of e-mail history should be saved locally on the device. You could have

0:01:08.550,0:01:13.000
a string stored integer preferences for what the currently selected account and

0:01:13.000,0:01:17.620
device is. Then at any time you can fetch the value of this shared preferences,

0:01:17.620,0:01:19.540
as long as you pass in the name of the key that you want.

0:01:19.540,0:01:24.060
You can also use shared preferences outside the context of settings as well.

0:01:24.060,0:01:27.080
This information is located in the developer API guide, for

0:01:27.080,0:01:29.530
storage options, which is also linked below.
