Alright, you're done.

0:00:02.190,0:00:03.390
Let's take a look at the solution.

0:00:04.460,0:00:09.050
Hopefully, you added a provider tag[br]to the Androidmanifest.xml file to

0:00:09.050,0:00:12.695
register the weather provider[br]class with the content authority.

0:00:12.695,0:00:16.184
The authorities attribute needs to[br]match the content authority from

0:00:16.184,0:00:17.685
the weather contract,

0:00:17.685,0:00:22.205
while the name attribute needs to match[br]the class name of your weather provider.

0:00:22.205,0:00:25.565
Note that you don't have to[br]specify the full package name.

0:00:25.565,0:00:28.615
The additional package of the class[br]is all you need, as I did here.
