Let's take the look at the[br]implementation, of an optional method,

0:00:02.719,0:00:04.939
we've got in the content provider.

0:00:04.939,0:00:07.220
Anyone out there who has[br]done work with SQLite,

0:00:07.220,0:00:10.430
knows that putting a bunch of[br]inserts into a single transaction is

0:00:10.430,0:00:13.040
much faster than inserting[br]them individually.

0:00:13.040,0:00:15.100
BulkInsert allows us to do that.

0:00:15.100,0:00:18.900
The default implementation,[br]just calls insert a bunch of times.

0:00:18.900,0:00:22.520
But, we can wrap it in a transaction,[br]if we implement it ourselves.

0:00:22.520,0:00:26.270
Note that we've only added support for[br]weather forecast transactions here,

0:00:26.270,0:00:28.930
since they are the only[br]ones we insert in bulk.

0:00:28.930,0:00:32.320
We start by calling db.beginTransaction.

0:00:32.320,0:00:36.860
For each of the content values[br]passed in, we insert and

0:00:36.860,0:00:39.190
update the number of records inserted.

0:00:39.190,0:00:42.770
When we're done,[br]we set the transaction to be successful.

0:00:42.770,0:00:46.092
And then rely on the finally[br]statement endTransaction.

0:00:46.092,0:00:49.140
Note, that if we do not set[br]the transaction to be successful,

0:00:49.140,0:00:52.460
the records will not be committed[br]when we call endTransaction.
