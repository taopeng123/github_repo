We've given you codes for the beginnings[br]of a weather provider class within

0:00:03.900,0:00:06.800
the data package that[br]extends content provider.

0:00:06.800,0:00:10.330
One of the tools that Android provides[br]to help write a content provider

0:00:10.330,0:00:14.105
is a UriMatcher,[br]which we are going to write shortly.

0:00:14.105,0:00:19.215
Filling out a UriMatcher is the third[br]step in building our content provider.

0:00:19.215,0:00:21.925
Content providers implement[br]functionality based upon

0:00:21.925,0:00:23.905
URIs passed to them.

0:00:23.905,0:00:27.232
Our content provider will[br]implement four types of URIs.

0:00:27.232,0:00:30.692
Each one of these URIs will be used to[br]execute different types of operations

0:00:30.692,0:00:34.122
against the underlying SQL databases.

0:00:34.122,0:00:35.752
For ease of implementation,

0:00:35.752,0:00:40.490
content providers typically tie each URI[br]type internally to an integer constant.

0:00:40.490,0:00:43.960
These integer constants have already[br]been added to the provided weather

0:00:43.960,0:00:45.640
provider class.

0:00:45.640,0:00:49.750
Android provides a UriMatcher[br]class to help match incoming URIs

0:00:49.750,0:00:52.380
to the content provider[br]integer constants.

0:00:52.380,0:00:56.110
This is important because we need to[br]have a way of knowing which type of URI

0:00:56.110,0:01:00.130
is passed into our content provider so[br]we can perform the requested operation.

0:01:00.130,0:01:01.660
Once we have the integer constants,

0:01:01.660,0:01:04.105
we can easily use them[br]in switch statements.

0:01:04.105,0:01:08.670
UriMatcher provides for an expression[br]syntax to match various URIs that

0:01:08.670,0:01:10.290
works a bit like regular expressions.

0:01:11.300,0:01:14.180
Hash symbols will match a number.

0:01:14.180,0:01:16.240
And an asterisk will match any string.

0:01:17.400,0:01:18.360
Here are some examples
