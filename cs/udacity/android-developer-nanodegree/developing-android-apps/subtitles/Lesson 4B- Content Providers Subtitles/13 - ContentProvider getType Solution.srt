0:00:00.003,0:00:04.740
The WEATHER_WITH_LOCATION_AND_DATE[br]function can only return a single row.

0:00:04.740,0:00:06.656
So we give it the ITEM_TYPE.

0:00:06.656,0:00:10.278
While the WEATHER_WITH_LOCATION[br]type returns multiple items.

0:00:10.278,0:00:13.270
So it gets CONTENT_TYPE, which is a dir.
