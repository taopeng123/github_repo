We're still not actually inserting[br]weather data into the ContentProvider.

0:00:05.210,0:00:08.270
So, this is a good time to[br]talk about BulkInserts.

0:00:08.270,0:00:11.380
Remember, that BulkInsert allows[br]us to insert multiple rows

0:00:11.380,0:00:14.840
far more efficiently by using[br]a database transaction.

0:00:14.840,0:00:18.130
We can apply this when we need to[br]insert 14 days worth of weather data

0:00:18.130,0:00:19.720
into the table.

0:00:19.720,0:00:24.650
Use the ContentProvider to BulkInsert[br]the vector of content values into

0:00:24.650,0:00:26.250
the database.

0:00:26.250,0:00:30.995
Note, there are a few lines underneath[br]the area where you add your BulkInsert

0:00:30.995,0:00:35.280
code that you can use to test displaying[br]the values you just inserted.

0:00:35.280,0:00:39.300
It will read those values out of[br]the data base, create content values for

0:00:39.300,0:00:42.520
them, and pass them into the same[br]display function we already have.
