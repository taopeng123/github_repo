Alright, you're done!

0:00:02.800,0:00:04.540
Let's take a look at the solution.

0:00:04.540,0:00:07.200
For weather,[br]we just get a readable database and

0:00:07.200,0:00:11.040
pass all of these parameters[br]from the content provider call.

0:00:11.040,0:00:15.000
The solution for weather and[br]location is pretty much the same.

0:00:15.000,0:00:18.810
For each one, we're going to pass the[br]parameters that come through the content

0:00:18.810,0:00:22.380
provider into the query function[br]of our readable database.

0:00:22.380,0:00:25.860
Again, these are the parameters that[br]come through the content provider, and

0:00:25.860,0:00:29.630
these are the parameters that[br]we pass into the database.

0:00:29.630,0:00:31.330
Location looks approximately the same.
