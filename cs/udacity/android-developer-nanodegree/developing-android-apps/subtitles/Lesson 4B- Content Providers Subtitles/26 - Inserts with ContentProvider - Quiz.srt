The refactoring you just[br]completed gets our code

0:00:02.790,0:00:05.170
ready to use the weather provider.

0:00:05.170,0:00:09.100
For this quiz, you're going to[br]code the addLocation method.

0:00:09.100,0:00:13.710
As you can see, this method takes[br]a locationSetting, cityName,

0:00:13.710,0:00:16.070
latitude and longitude for[br]the new location.

0:00:17.320,0:00:22.960
If the location already exists, we[br]return the ID of the existing location.

0:00:22.960,0:00:27.690
If we add a location,[br]we return the ID of the added location.

0:00:27.690,0:00:30.670
We can do this by first[br]querying the content provider,

0:00:30.670,0:00:34.020
to see if the location[br]query already exists, and

0:00:34.020,0:00:37.220
only performing the insert[br]if it doesn't yet exist.

0:00:37.220,0:00:41.120
Uncomment test add location[br]within test fetch weather task,

0:00:41.120,0:00:42.290
to validate your solution.
