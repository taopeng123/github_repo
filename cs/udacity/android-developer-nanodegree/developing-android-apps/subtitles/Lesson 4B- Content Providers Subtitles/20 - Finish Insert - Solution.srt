All right, you're done.

0:00:02.220,0:00:04.130
Let's take a look at the solution.

0:00:04.130,0:00:07.330
Adding support for the location[br]insert looks almost identical

0:00:07.330,0:00:09.100
to adding the support for weather.

0:00:09.100,0:00:14.620
We just have to select the right table[br]name, and return the right location URI.

0:00:14.620,0:00:18.570
Remember, at the end of the function,[br]we can just call notify change on

0:00:18.570,0:00:21.584
the content resolver to notify[br]all of the registered observers.

0:00:22.780,0:00:27.210
Note that we must use the past in URI,[br]and not the return URI,

0:00:27.210,0:00:30.540
as that will not correctly notify[br]our cursors of the change.

0:00:30.540,0:00:33.980
Since we also uncommented[br]test insert read provider,

0:00:33.980,0:00:37.910
lets run our test just to make sure[br]everything's still working well.

0:00:37.910,0:00:39.820
Note that nothing appears[br]on device screen.

0:00:41.000,0:00:42.420
And, our test passed.

0:00:42.420,0:00:44.850
We're well on our way to[br]building our content provider.
