The solution of the previous quiz said that we

0:00:02.360,0:00:05.030
had to define the wide detail fragment layout in two

0:00:05.030,0:00:09.630
places. The layout-land and the layout-sw600dp folder. To avoid having

0:00:09.630,0:00:13.050
multiple copies of this file, we should use layout aliasing.

0:00:13.050,0:00:15.700
We can check the documentation for layout aliases to see

0:00:15.700,0:00:18.670
an example. Say we have a main layout file that's

0:00:18.670,0:00:22.177
for one pane UI. In the layout large and layout-sw600dp

0:00:22.177,0:00:25.190
folders, we want a multi pane layout. In case you're

0:00:25.190,0:00:28.380
wondering, layout large is for backward compatibility purposes for

0:00:28.380,0:00:32.280
large devices prior to Android 3.2, that's when the SW

0:00:32.280,0:00:35.340
qualifiers were introduced. So back to the point. To

0:00:35.340,0:00:38.290
avoid code duplication, we can define the two pane layout

0:00:38.290,0:00:41.161
in the base layout folder. Then, in the values-large

0:00:41.161,0:00:44.870
and values-sw600dp folders, we can create a reference so that

0:00:44.870,0:00:48.100
the main layout actually maps to the two pane layout.

0:00:48.100,0:00:50.950
In the Java code, you can reference it as r.layout.main,

0:00:50.950,0:00:53.640
but it's actually referencing the two pane layout.

0:00:53.640,0:00:55.110
This is what the detail fragment should look

0:00:55.110,0:00:57.070
like afterwards. And this is what the phone

0:00:57.070,0:00:59.610
landscape view looks like. If you rotate the

0:00:59.610,0:01:02.460
device, the phone portrait view should be different.

0:01:02.460,0:01:04.400
In the next coding task, we're going to make

0:01:04.400,0:01:07.800
the today list item look more like the other items in the list for the tablet.
