Hurray, you're done implementing wire frames for the app! Now

0:00:03.440,0:00:06.150
comes the visual polish part, where we tweak the styles

0:00:06.150,0:00:08.950
and the views to make the app look awesome. Here

0:00:08.950,0:00:10.620
are the visual mocks, for what the app should look

0:00:10.620,0:00:13.310
like, when we're done. If you work with a designer,

0:00:13.310,0:00:16.050
they should also give you red lines. Red lines specify

0:00:16.050,0:00:21.990
everything from sizes, font styles, colors, spacing, et cetera. This

0:00:21.990,0:00:25.160
should help you achieve pixel perfect layouts that match the

0:00:25.160,0:00:28.500
visual mocks. How did we come up with these values?

0:00:28.500,0:00:31.370
Well we used the Android design guide, which has information on

0:00:31.370,0:00:34.060
metrics and grids, and we adapted them to fit our

0:00:34.060,0:00:36.920
app's needs. You can click on the link for more info.
