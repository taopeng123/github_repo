Let me the explain the reasoning that I use when I

0:00:02.190,0:00:05.150
look at a new layout. It looks like there's two equally spaced

0:00:05.150,0:00:09.120
columns here. That signals to me we need linear layout weights,

0:00:09.120,0:00:12.460
where each of these have equal weights. So let's create a horizontal

0:00:12.460,0:00:16.712
linear layout. Within this first chart, we have three vertically stacked

0:00:16.712,0:00:19.830
text views, so we have a vertical linear layout, and the same

0:00:19.830,0:00:23.030
goes for this second chart with has two elements vertically stacked

0:00:23.030,0:00:25.570
on top of each other, which means we use a vertical linear

0:00:25.570,0:00:28.220
layout as well. And here's the code, we created a

0:00:28.220,0:00:32.490
new list item forecasts today XML file under the layout folder.

0:00:32.490,0:00:35.340
The code looks very similar to list item forecast. I

0:00:35.340,0:00:38.540
has a horizontal linear layout, as a root element. The first

0:00:38.540,0:00:41.370
channel is a vertical linear layout with the width zero

0:00:41.370,0:00:44.970
and a weight of one. The second child is another vertical

0:00:44.970,0:00:47.300
linear layout with a width of zero and a weight

0:00:47.300,0:00:50.600
of one, that way the horizontal space will be distributed evenly

0:00:50.600,0:00:53.200
among each child. If you go back to the first

0:00:53.200,0:00:55.700
linear layout, notice that we have three text views within

0:00:55.700,0:00:59.630
it. For date, high temperature, and low temperature. We specify

0:00:59.630,0:01:02.550
gravity to be center horizontal. So anything within the linear

0:01:02.550,0:01:06.220
layout will be centered horizontally. Otherwise, by default, they would

0:01:06.220,0:01:09.590
be left aligned to the linear layout. The same applies

0:01:09.590,0:01:12.270
for the second linear layout. We specify gravity to be

0:01:12.270,0:01:15.720
center horizontal so that the icon and the weather forecast

0:01:15.720,0:01:18.130
text view within it are also centered horizontally.
