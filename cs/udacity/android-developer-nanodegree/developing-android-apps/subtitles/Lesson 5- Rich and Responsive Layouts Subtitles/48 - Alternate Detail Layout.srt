We definitely need to define fragment detail in the

0:00:02.540,0:00:04.930
base layout folder, then we override it in the

0:00:04.930,0:00:07.300
layout land folder, so that we can achieve this

0:00:07.300,0:00:11.000
layout on phone landscape orientation. Tablet landscape view would

0:00:11.000,0:00:13.200
work fine because of this folder, but then tablet

0:00:13.200,0:00:15.450
portrait would fall back to this layout so we

0:00:15.450,0:00:18.830
should just define it in the layout sw600dp folder

0:00:18.830,0:00:21.960
so that all tablets regardless of orientation use this layout
