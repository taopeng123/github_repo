When we were learning that response in design, we saw that

0:00:02.600,0:00:05.360
a common pattern was to use the master detail flow, which

0:00:05.360,0:00:08.410
is what were going to use for sunshine. Here are the

0:00:08.410,0:00:11.580
tablet mocks. We have a list of forecasts on the left, and

0:00:11.580,0:00:14.220
then for the selected item, we see the detail pane on

0:00:14.220,0:00:18.080
the right. This applies for a seven inch and ten inch tablets.

0:00:18.080,0:00:22.380
Both portrait and landscape orientations. In portrait mode, the columns are

0:00:22.380,0:00:25.670
just a little bit narrower, but it's still a two pane UI.

0:00:25.670,0:00:28.220
In terms of implementation, all of this will be under the

0:00:28.220,0:00:31.020
main activity. Then on the left, we have the forecast fragment.

0:00:31.020,0:00:34.070
And then on the right, we have the detail fragment. On

0:00:34.070,0:00:36.846
the phone, we would still have the main activity with the list

0:00:36.846,0:00:39.580
of forecast. And then selecting an item would still launch the

0:00:39.580,0:00:44.480
detail activity. Here's another way to visualize it. On the tablet, we

0:00:44.480,0:00:47.630
have two fragments side by side under one activity. And then

0:00:47.630,0:00:51.030
on the phone, we have the first activity containing the first fragment.

0:00:51.030,0:00:54.080
Selecting an item will launch the second activity containing the second

0:00:54.080,0:00:57.640
fragment. We're going to break this up into multiple coding tasks until

0:00:57.640,0:01:00.140
we build up the final layout. First we'll build up the

0:01:00.140,0:01:03.460
two pane UI for tablets. Then we'll hook up the communication

0:01:03.460,0:01:07.070
between the two fragments, so that's selecting an item replaces the

0:01:07.070,0:01:09.530
detail pane on the right. Then we'll learn how to show

0:01:09.530,0:01:12.590
an activated state on the currently selected item, so we know

0:01:12.590,0:01:16.100
what the details pane corresponds to. We'll also need to make

0:01:16.100,0:01:18.630
sure that the scroll position is maintained across

0:01:18.630,0:01:22.430
orientation changes. After that, we'll update the detail layout

0:01:22.430,0:01:24.730
so it's optimized for these wider screens. And

0:01:24.730,0:01:27.370
then we'll modify the adapter so that today's layout

0:01:27.370,0:01:29.340
looks like the other days. There's no special

0:01:29.340,0:01:31.980
today layout on the tablet. So hopefully it's clear

0:01:31.980,0:01:34.930
how we're going to approach implementing this tablet behavior and

0:01:34.930,0:01:36.660
we're going to step through it slowly, one by one
