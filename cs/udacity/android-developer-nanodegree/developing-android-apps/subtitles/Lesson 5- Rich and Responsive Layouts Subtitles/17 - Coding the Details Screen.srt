0:00:00.150,0:00:02.330
You've implemented the main[br]activity wireframe, so

0:00:02.330,0:00:05.050
now we can move onto[br]the detail activity wireframe.

0:00:05.050,0:00:06.120
This is what it looks like.

0:00:06.120,0:00:08.500
We have the date, the high and[br]low temperatures, and

0:00:08.500,0:00:10.010
then additional weather information.

0:00:10.010,0:00:13.030
We also have the weather icon,[br]and the weather forecast.

0:00:13.030,0:00:14.470
And these line up horizontally.

0:00:14.470,0:00:17.240
Build up the layout XML for[br]this wire frame.

0:00:17.240,0:00:21.060
Then modify the detail fragments that[br]you can populate all this information,

0:00:21.060,0:00:22.490
including these new views.

0:00:22.490,0:00:25.640
While you're doing that, you might as[br]well move the detail fragment into its

0:00:25.640,0:00:28.750
own file, so[br]it's separate from the detail activity.

0:00:28.750,0:00:32.290
Before you get started, I want to point[br]out that this layout has the information

0:00:32.290,0:00:33.960
taking up a lot of vertical space.

0:00:33.960,0:00:36.320
If you rotate your device[br]into landscape mode, or

0:00:36.320,0:00:37.880
you have a smaller height device,.

0:00:37.880,0:00:39.650
Some of the content could get cut off.

0:00:39.650,0:00:42.870
So think about how you can make this[br]layout be vertically scrollable.

0:00:42.870,0:00:43.910
To show you what I mean,

0:00:43.910,0:00:46.770
I added a couple of more lines of[br]text at the bottom of the layout.

0:00:46.770,0:00:48.680
Then I made the content[br]vertically scrollable.

0:00:48.680,0:00:50.340
So you could see all the information.

0:00:50.340,0:00:52.970
So go ahead and[br]make that change to your layout as well.

0:00:52.970,0:00:55.840
When you're done with all these steps,[br]this is what the App should look like.

0:00:55.840,0:00:57.878
We don't care about[br]the visual details now.

0:00:57.878,0:00:59.970
We just want to make sure that[br]the functionality is hooked up, so

0:00:59.970,0:01:02.390
all the right information[br]is displayed on screen.

0:01:02.390,0:01:05.590
You can use the code snippets provided[br]below for helper functions and

0:01:05.590,0:01:07.500
strings that you're going to need.

0:01:07.500,0:01:09.950
And again, leaving a place[br]holder image is fine for now.
