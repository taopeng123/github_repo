In the forecast fragment, we create a position variable. Whenever an item

0:00:03.790,0:00:07.234
is clicked, we update the position. Then, in the on save instance

0:00:07.234,0:00:10.230
state method, we store the position in the bundle. If the app

0:00:10.230,0:00:13.620
gets killed, then we can restore the position from the save state bundle.

0:00:13.620,0:00:16.598
This is on the onCreate view method. The reason we store in

0:00:16.598,0:00:19.573
a global variable is because the list view probably hasn't been populated

0:00:19.573,0:00:22.570
yet. We wait for the onload finish callback to happen when the

0:00:22.570,0:00:25.510
cursor is swapped. Then, we can tell the list view to set selection

0:00:25.510,0:00:28.020
on that position, and that position will be scrolled into view.
