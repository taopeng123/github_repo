0:00:00.090,0:00:02.130
We mentioned this several times. Put the SW in

0:00:02.130,0:00:06.190
the resource folder name stands for smallest width. To drive

0:00:06.190,0:00:09.280
home that point, let's walk through a hypothetical situation. Say

0:00:09.280,0:00:11.760
you have an app directory structure like this. We have

0:00:11.760,0:00:14.140
some layouts defined in the base layout folder and

0:00:14.140,0:00:18.070
we override some of those in the layout-sw600dp folder. We

0:00:18.070,0:00:22.790
also override one of these in the layout-sw720dp folder. Let's

0:00:22.790,0:00:25.320
look at which layouts would be applied on which device.

0:00:25.320,0:00:27.740
Say your app is running on a Nexxus five.

0:00:27.740,0:00:30.510
The Nexxus five has dimensions 360 dp by six 640

0:00:30.510,0:00:33.610
dp. Of the two, the smallest width is 360 dp.

0:00:33.610,0:00:36.350
So we use this number to compare it against the

0:00:36.350,0:00:39.950
folder names. 360 dp is less than 600 and

0:00:39.950,0:00:43.020
is less than, 720 so all the layouts will come

0:00:43.020,0:00:47.420
from the space layout folder. For the Nexus 72012 version,

0:00:47.420,0:00:50.950
the dimensions are 600 dp by 960 dp. Of the

0:00:50.950,0:00:54.470
two sides 600 dp is the smaller width. So you compare

0:00:54.470,0:00:57.830
this against the folder names. It turns out that the smallest width

0:00:57.830,0:01:00.710
is greater than or equal to 600 dp, so for the

0:01:00.710,0:01:03.800
detail and the item layout, we pull it from this folder. Now

0:01:03.800,0:01:06.370
the main .xml file is not declared in this folder, so

0:01:06.370,0:01:09.020
we fall back to a less specific folder, which turns out to

0:01:09.020,0:01:11.968
be this one in the base layout folder. For the Nexus ten,

0:01:11.968,0:01:15.920
the dimensions are 800 dp by 1280 dp. Of the two sides,

0:01:15.920,0:01:19.220
800 dp is the smallest width. Now this device satisfies

0:01:19.220,0:01:22.100
the categories for all of these because 800 is greater than

0:01:22.100,0:01:24.990
720 and greater than 600. However, the system chooses the

0:01:24.990,0:01:28.550
most specific folder first. So it will choose this item layout

0:01:28.550,0:01:31.050
over these two. Since the detail layout is not defined

0:01:31.050,0:01:33.820
here, it will fall back to a less specific folder, which

0:01:33.820,0:01:36.810
is this one. Then for the main.xml file, it's not declared

0:01:36.810,0:01:38.930
in either of these, so it falls back to this one.
