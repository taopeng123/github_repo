We're not quite done yet, with implementing the tablet UI wire

0:00:02.820,0:00:06.020
frames. The detail fragment should look like this, but instead it

0:00:06.020,0:00:09.110
looks more like this. For the tablet UI, we try to

0:00:09.110,0:00:12.880
optimize it more, for wider screens like tablet landscape mode. Another

0:00:12.880,0:00:15.340
good place for this layout, is in the phone landscape view,

0:00:15.340,0:00:19.120
where there's more horizontal space, than vertical space. For this quiz,

0:00:19.120,0:00:21.820
figure out which layout folders, we would need to define the

0:00:21.820,0:00:25.350
fragment detail layout in. In order to achieve this layout on phone

0:00:25.350,0:00:28.010
portrait, and this layout for phone landscape and tablet.
