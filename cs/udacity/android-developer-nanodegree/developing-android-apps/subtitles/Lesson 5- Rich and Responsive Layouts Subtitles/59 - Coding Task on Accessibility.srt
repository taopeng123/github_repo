Thanks for your answer. If you tried talkback on the

0:00:02.990,0:00:05.890
Sunshine app, you'll notice that one easy fix to make our

0:00:05.890,0:00:09.210
app more accessible is to add content descriptions to our image

0:00:09.210,0:00:12.240
views. 'Cause there's no spoken text when a user talks on

0:00:12.240,0:00:15.100
it. In the forecaster adopter after we read the weather

0:00:15.100,0:00:18.130
forecast from the cursor, we also set it as a content

0:00:18.130,0:00:22.240
description on the icon. Similarly, in the detail fragment, once we

0:00:22.240,0:00:25.520
get the weather forecast, we set that as the content description

0:00:25.520,0:00:29.510
on the icon. Now clicking on the image speaks the weather description out loud.
