So you've got a pretty sweet looking control, but what about

0:00:02.700,0:00:07.160
users who can't see the shiny hotness? Accessibility is a key consideration

0:00:07.160,0:00:10.560
when building apps and particularly when you're creating new views. You

0:00:10.560,0:00:13.850
can start by adding a content description, as you would for every

0:00:13.850,0:00:16.360
other view in your layout, to ensure that they are all

0:00:16.360,0:00:19.820
accessible. But what about views like our wind speed, and direction gauge,

0:00:19.820,0:00:23.250
where the content isn't static? Knowing you're looking at a wind

0:00:23.250,0:00:25.630
gauge isn't very useful if you don't know what the speed and

0:00:25.630,0:00:28.640
direction it's displaying are. Well, there are couple

0:00:28.640,0:00:32.020
of options here. For generic views, which don't control

0:00:32.020,0:00:34.890
their own values, this simplest alternative is to

0:00:34.890,0:00:38.485
set the content description within your app at runtime.

0:00:38.485,0:00:40.280
An even more robust solution is to send

0:00:40.280,0:00:43.480
an accessibility event from within your view. Whenever the

0:00:43.480,0:00:46.990
visual content has been modified. Then override the dispatch

0:00:46.990,0:00:50.830
populate accessibility event, and then the current control's visual

0:00:50.830,0:00:54.534
value, the accessibility event. Go ahead and add accessibility handlers

0:00:54.534,0:00:56.730
to your view and then click here when you're done.
