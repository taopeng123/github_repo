0:00:00.210,0:00:01.530
And here's the solution.

0:00:01.530,0:00:02.920
In the Utility class,

0:00:02.920,0:00:05.830
we add all the helper methods[br]that were provided in the gist.

0:00:05.830,0:00:09.820
We also declare the related[br]strings in the strings.xml file.

0:00:09.820,0:00:13.252
After we read the high temperature[br]value from the cursor, we go and

0:00:13.252,0:00:18.060
try to find the TextView represented[br]by the ID list_item_high_textview.

0:00:18.060,0:00:21.470
Then we use a Utility function[br]to format the temperature so

0:00:21.470,0:00:23.890
that it can be displayed[br]in the TextView.

0:00:23.890,0:00:25.900
Then we do the same for[br]the low temperature value.
