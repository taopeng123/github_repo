0:00:00.780,0:00:03.490
In the main activity, we tell the forecast fragment to use a

0:00:03.490,0:00:07.030
special today layout if it's one pane mode. In the fragment, we

0:00:07.030,0:00:10.320
pass on this value to the forecast adapter, if it's not null.

0:00:10.320,0:00:13.430
The reason it could be null is because the activity on Create method

0:00:13.430,0:00:16.900
will happen before the fragment on Create View method. And this is

0:00:16.900,0:00:20.580
where the forecast adapter is initialized. So we set the Boolean here,

0:00:20.580,0:00:23.200
as well. The reason we have this code here is because it's

0:00:23.200,0:00:26.180
a public method. So, in the future, it could be called before or

0:00:26.180,0:00:27.230
after this method.
