0:00:00.190,0:00:01.609
Earlier we learned about styles and

0:00:01.609,0:00:04.470
how you can apply them[br]to an individual view.

0:00:04.470,0:00:07.580
If you want to apply it to all the views[br]in an activity or application,

0:00:07.580,0:00:11.330
you can do it by specifying a theme[br]attribute on the activity or

0:00:11.330,0:00:14.600
application tag in the Android manifest.

0:00:14.600,0:00:17.990
Now we style the action bar to look[br]like these visual mocks for the main and

0:00:17.990,0:00:19.020
detail activity.

0:00:19.020,0:00:22.750
The settings activity is a special case[br]because it extends from the preference

0:00:22.750,0:00:26.100
activity class,[br]instead of the action bar activity.

0:00:26.100,0:00:28.180
So that's going to be[br]done in the next section.

0:00:28.180,0:00:31.040
For both cases here we want[br]the background color to be this

0:00:31.040,0:00:32.330
blue hex color.

0:00:32.330,0:00:36.250
We notice that the detail activity[br]only shows the title, no app icon.

0:00:36.250,0:00:39.220
And this button is to go[br]up to the parent activity.

0:00:39.220,0:00:41.950
If you see visual marks[br]that have the app icon or

0:00:41.950,0:00:44.260
a different up button,[br]they are outdated.

0:00:44.260,0:00:46.570
The material design,[br]this is our new look.

0:00:46.570,0:00:49.380
On the other hand,[br]the main activity shows the logo.

0:00:49.380,0:00:51.200
It's a different attribute[br]than the app icon.

0:00:51.200,0:00:54.980
And this was provided in an acid[br]drop earlier in the lesson, and

0:00:54.980,0:00:57.350
it's called ic_logo.

0:00:57.350,0:01:00.630
Because of these differences,[br]we need two separate themes.

0:01:00.630,0:01:05.450
We use AppTheme for the detail activity[br]and ForecastTheme for the main activity.

0:01:06.580,0:01:09.660
In material design you can[br]choose several app colors and

0:01:09.660,0:01:13.700
specify them in your theme to[br]colorize certain UI components

0:01:13.700,0:01:15.380
that are controlled by the framework.

0:01:15.380,0:01:19.940
For example the framework will use[br]colorPrimary as a background of your

0:01:19.940,0:01:21.700
action bar or your tool bar.

0:01:21.700,0:01:24.160
The framework will also[br]use colorPrimaryDark

0:01:24.160,0:01:26.200
as the status bar color.

0:01:26.200,0:01:30.578
To customize our app theme, go to[br]the Styles file in the values folder.

0:01:30.578,0:01:34.480
Our AppTheme inherits[br]from the system Theme for

0:01:34.480,0:01:39.380
a Light app because we have a Light[br]content area with a DarkActionBar.

0:01:39.380,0:01:42.650
We specify colorPrimary to[br]be this sunshine_blue color.

0:01:42.650,0:01:46.050
And this will be displayed in[br]the action bar, also known as at bar.

0:01:46.050,0:01:50.770
And then we set the colorPrimaryDark[br]to be this darker color.

0:01:50.770,0:01:52.280
This is going to be[br]shown in the status bar,

0:01:52.280,0:01:57.340
and typically the status bar is[br]a darker color than the at bar.

0:01:57.340,0:02:03.315
Both of these colors are defined in[br]the colors.xml file as seen here.

0:02:03.315,0:02:07.290
Then for the main activity,[br]we create a ForecastTheme.

0:02:07.290,0:02:11.230
We inherit from AppTheme in case[br]there's more attributes that we want to

0:02:11.230,0:02:13.880
add here, and[br]then we'll inherit them for free.

0:02:13.880,0:02:16.460
However, we do override[br]the actionBarStyle.

0:02:16.460,0:02:21.510
This is so that we can set the logo[br]to point to this drawable file and

0:02:21.510,0:02:25.190
also change the displayOptions so[br]that the logo does appear.

0:02:25.190,0:02:27.410
For more information on[br]the action bar displayOptions,

0:02:27.410,0:02:28.940
you can see the list here.

0:02:28.940,0:02:30.100
If you run the app now,

0:02:30.100,0:02:33.320
there's a shadow below the action[br]bar that is default behavior.

0:02:33.320,0:02:36.990
However, according to our visual[br]designs, we want the action bar and

0:02:36.990,0:02:41.050
the today item with the blue[br]background to be on the same plane,

0:02:41.050,0:02:44.430
meaning we don't want one to[br]cast a shadow over the other.

0:02:44.430,0:02:47.450
As a result we set the action[br]bar elevation to be zero

0:02:47.450,0:02:49.140
if it is in one pane mode.

0:02:49.140,0:02:54.700
If it's in two pane mode, then the today[br]item does not have a special background,

0:02:54.700,0:02:57.380
and it's fine if the action[br]bar casts a shadow.

0:02:57.380,0:03:00.250
Go ahead and make these changes[br]now using the gists provided.
