0:00:08.619,0:00:11.190
the Nexus One and the Nexus 5? For these

0:00:11.190,0:00:13.080
purposes, the screen size should be one of

0:00:13.080,0:00:17.580
the available buckets, small, normal, large, or extra large.

0:00:17.580,0:00:19.580

of our buckets, LDPI, MDPI, HDPI, XHDPI, or XXHDPI.
