0:00:00.370,0:00:02.800
Going back to the wire frames. In the phone layout, we

0:00:02.800,0:00:05.570
wanted the today item to be a little bit bigger. But on

0:00:05.570,0:00:07.410
the tablets, we just want it to look like all the

0:00:07.410,0:00:11.970
other items, because we have an expanded detail pane here. To do

0:00:11.970,0:00:15.320
this in the forecast adapter new view method, we should return

0:00:15.320,0:00:19.060
the layout for a list item forecast not for the today layout.

0:00:19.060,0:00:21.760
Then in the bind view method, for the today item, we

0:00:21.760,0:00:25.470
should use the gray icon instead of the colored icon. These decisions

0:00:25.470,0:00:29.140
get controlled by the return value of the getItemViewType method. Therefore,

0:00:29.140,0:00:32.830
we modify the getItemViewType method so that at the zero position,

0:00:32.830,0:00:35.080
if we have to use the special today layout, then we

0:00:35.080,0:00:38.240
return view type today. Otherwise, if we shouldn't use the special

0:00:38.240,0:00:40.620
today layout, then we should just return the view type for

0:00:40.620,0:00:43.800
all future days. This Boolean is controlled by the setter method.

0:00:43.800,0:00:46.790
To access this Boolean, we created a public setter method on

0:00:46.790,0:00:50.620
the forecast adapter. But who knows how to set this value properly?

0:00:50.620,0:00:52.380
Well the main activity knows whether it's one pane,

0:00:52.380,0:00:54.730
or two pane UI. So, it can decide whether

0:00:54.730,0:00:56.650
we should use the special today layout or not.

0:00:57.670,0:01:00.040
We don't have access to the forecast adapter here, but

0:01:00.040,0:01:03.020
we can plumb the value through the forecast fragment.

0:01:03.020,0:01:05.319
To get access to the forecast fragment, we can ask

0:01:05.319,0:01:07.350
the fragment manager and pass it the fragment ID.

0:01:08.600,0:01:10.710
Finish changing the code so the app looks like this.
