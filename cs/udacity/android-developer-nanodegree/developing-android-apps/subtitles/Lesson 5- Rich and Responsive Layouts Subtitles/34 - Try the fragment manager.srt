I've mentioned the FragmentManager, FragmentTransactions in the back stack

0:00:03.730,0:00:06.410
a few times. Now, take a look at the documentation

0:00:06.410,0:00:09.370
on the Android developer site, and complete the code,

0:00:09.370,0:00:11.990
which will replace the contents of the fragment container with

0:00:11.990,0:00:14.550
a new instance of the details fragment. Keep in

0:00:14.550,0:00:17.060
mind that this transaction should allow the user to reverse

0:00:17.060,0:00:19.460
the transaction using the Back button. And in this

0:00:19.460,0:00:21.990
case, we'll be calling this code from within an activity.
