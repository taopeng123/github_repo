In this lesson, we learned how to create rich, responsive

0:00:03.070,0:00:06.030
user interfaces that work across a variety of different hardware

0:00:06.030,0:00:09.180
types and screen sizes. We also learned more details on

0:00:09.180,0:00:12.020
the Android layout managers and screen widgets and even had to

0:00:12.020,0:00:15.500
create our own views from scratch. Join us for lesson

six where we take our foreground-only app and discover how to

0:00:18.900,0:00:22.100
make it update and trigger notifications from the background, all

0:00:22.100,0:00:25.650
without draining your battery. But first, join me back at Google
