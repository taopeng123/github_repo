On the tablet, there's a bug where if you select an item near

0:00:03.015,0:00:05.952
the bottom of the list and then you rotate the device, the selected

0:00:05.952,0:00:08.888
item is no longer scrolled into view. You have to manually scroll the

0:00:08.888,0:00:12.270
list. That means we should store the position of the selected item in

0:00:12.270,0:00:14.430
the savedInstanceState Bundle. If the app

0:00:14.430,0:00:16.120
is killed, when it's restored, we should

0:00:16.120,0:00:19.030
read the position back from the Bundle. If the list isn't populated at

0:00:19.030,0:00:22.220
that time, then we should wait for the onLoadFinished callback to use a

0:00:22.220,0:00:25.400
position to scroll to the selected item. Check these boxes when you're done.
