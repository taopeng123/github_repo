0:00:00.496,0:00:04.750
In the ForecastAdaptor bindView method,[br]we have to traverse a view hierarchy to

0:00:04.750,0:00:07.480
find the views in order[br]to set data onto them.

0:00:07.480,0:00:08.890
If it's a recycled view,

0:00:08.890,0:00:12.450
meaning it's been used in the list[br]previously to display other data,

0:00:12.450,0:00:16.129
we still have to traverse the view[br]hierarchy to find all the views.

0:00:16.129,0:00:18.930
To remove unnecessary[br]find view by ID calls,

0:00:18.930,0:00:20.810
we can use the view holder pattern.

0:00:20.810,0:00:23.290
For a list item layout that[br]contains different views,

0:00:23.290,0:00:25.270
we can create a view holder object.

0:00:25.270,0:00:28.740
It contains member variables that[br]reference each view in the layout.

0:00:28.740,0:00:32.009
The view holder object is stored[br]in the tag field of the view.

0:00:32.009,0:00:35.022
The next time that the view[br]is recycled and used again,

0:00:35.022,0:00:38.113
we can just immediately set[br]the data onto these fields.

0:00:38.113,0:00:40.667
You don't have to go[br]find all the views again.

0:00:40.667,0:00:43.779
This is our ViewHolder class,[br]you can name it anything you want,

0:00:43.779,0:00:44.974
it's just a java class.

0:00:44.974,0:00:48.794
Given the list item layout,[br]we do all the fine view by ID calls.

0:00:48.794,0:00:51.778
That way, we can hold references[br]to all the child views.

0:00:51.778,0:00:53.020
In the newView method,

0:00:53.020,0:00:57.620
after we've inflated the view, we create[br]a new viewHolder object from that view.

0:00:57.620,0:01:00.190
Then we set the ViewHolder[br]as the tag of the view.

0:01:00.190,0:01:03.120
The tag can be used towards any object,[br]but don't abuse it,

0:01:03.120,0:01:05.650
because when you read it back, you[br]have to know what you stored in there.

0:01:07.640,0:01:09.720
Then in the adapter bindView call,

0:01:09.720,0:01:13.170
we read from the tag to get[br]back the viewHolder object.

0:01:13.170,0:01:16.300
Now we immediately have references to[br]all the individual views that we need to

0:01:16.300,0:01:20.040
update, such as the icon view,[br]date view, description view, and so on.
