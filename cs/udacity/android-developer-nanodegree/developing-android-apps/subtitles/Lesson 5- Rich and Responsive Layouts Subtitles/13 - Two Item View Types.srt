Currently, all the list[br]items have the same layout.

0:00:02.860,0:00:05.880
However, we want the today[br]item to use a different layout

0:00:05.880,0:00:10.320
which we defined earlier in the list[br]item forecast today XML file.

0:00:10.320,0:00:13.460
This is where adapter item[br]view types will save the day.

0:00:13.460,0:00:17.530
This is a general concept for[br]all adapters, not just cursor adapter.

0:00:17.530,0:00:21.180
Instead of just knowing about one item[br]view type which yields the same layout

0:00:21.180,0:00:25.570
for all list items, the adapter can[br]declare multiple item view types, so

0:00:25.570,0:00:28.020
it will have different[br]list item layouts.

0:00:28.020,0:00:31.330
For a given row in the cursor,[br]the forecast adapter needs to decide

0:00:31.330,0:00:34.610
if it should be a regular list item or[br]a today list item.

0:00:34.610,0:00:37.830
Then it will inflate, and[br]bind data for the appropriate layout.

0:00:37.830,0:00:40.810
We'll jump into the forecast[br]adapter code now to learn how to

0:00:40.810,0:00:42.760
handle a second item view type.

0:00:42.760,0:00:46.400
Normally, in a sub class[br]getViewTypeCount returns one, but

0:00:46.400,0:00:50.230
we're going to override it so it returns[br]two for the two different layouts.

0:00:50.230,0:00:52.870
But how does it know when to[br]use one layout, or the other?

0:00:52.870,0:00:56.830
Well we override getItemViewType, so[br]that when the position in the list is

0:00:56.830,0:00:59.760
zero then we say that[br]it's the today view type.

0:00:59.760,0:01:02.800
Otherwise, it's[br]the FUTURE_DAY view type.

0:01:02.800,0:01:05.280
These two view types[br]are declared up above.

0:01:05.280,0:01:08.760
These are just integer[br]representations of the view type.

0:01:08.760,0:01:12.500
The numbering has to start at 0, because[br]these values cannot be greater than or

0:01:12.500,0:01:14.830
equal to getViewTypeCount.

0:01:14.830,0:01:19.320
So the possible values for us are 0 and[br]1, so that we know that 0 always maps

0:01:19.320,0:01:23.610
to the view_type_today, and that one[br]always maps to view_type_future_day.

0:01:23.610,0:01:26.440
We're going to use this information[br]in the new view method.

0:01:26.440,0:01:30.330
Remember that previously,[br]we inflated the list item forecast xml.

0:01:30.330,0:01:34.370
Now we're going to use item view type[br]to determine whether we should use one

0:01:34.370,0:01:35.600
layout or the other.

0:01:35.600,0:01:37.710
Fill in the TODO to[br]address this behavior.

0:01:37.710,0:01:40.270
LayoutID refers to resourceID

0:01:40.270,0:01:42.890
which is in the form of r[br]dot layout dot something.
