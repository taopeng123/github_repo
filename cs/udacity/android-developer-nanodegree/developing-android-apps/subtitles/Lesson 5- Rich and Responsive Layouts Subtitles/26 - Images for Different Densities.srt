Beto mentioned that we should provide bit maps at different resolutions.

0:00:03.680,0:00:06.700
In our app, the 48 dib icon on the Nexus S

0:00:06.700,0:00:08.910
looks to be about the same size as on the Nexus

0:00:08.910,0:00:12.830
4, and on the Nexus 5. However, in reality, this asset

0:00:12.830,0:00:15.360
that's being displayed is actually a lot bigger in terms of

0:00:15.360,0:00:18.540
pixels compared to this one. To confirm, we can check out

0:00:18.540,0:00:21.940
the app resource folders. In the drawable folders, we see that

0:00:21.940,0:00:25.320
our app has a 48 by 48 pixel launcher icon for

0:00:25.320,0:00:29.068
mdpi devices located in the drawable mdpi folder. To

0:00:29.068,0:00:31.900
make an equivalent icon for the higher density devices,

0:00:31.900,0:00:34.780
we need to make that icon progressively larger. To

0:00:34.780,0:00:37.390
know exactly how big to make these images and

0:00:37.390,0:00:40.370
what the dibbed pixel conversion should be, we use

0:00:40.370,0:00:43.270
an mdpi device as the baseline. This is where

0:00:43.270,0:00:46.573
one dib equals one pixel. Then on the HDPI

0:00:46.573,0:00:50.793
device one dib equals 1.5 pixels. And then it increases

0:00:50.793,0:00:53.030
from there, all the way to an xx HDPI

0:00:53.030,0:00:56.570
device, where one dib equals four pixels. For more info

0:00:56.570,0:00:59.121
on the conversions, see the link below. Following those

0:00:59.121,0:01:01.461
rules, these are the sizes of the launcher icon in

0:01:01.461,0:01:05.319
our drawable folders. The MDPI one is 48 pixels

0:01:05.319,0:01:09.250
by 48 pixels. The one for HDPI is 1.5 times

0:01:09.250,0:01:13.360
the size of this one. From an XHDPI device,

0:01:13.360,0:01:15.970
the icon is two times the size of the MDPI

0:01:15.970,0:01:21.340
one, and for an XXHDPI device, the icon is the three times the size of this one.
