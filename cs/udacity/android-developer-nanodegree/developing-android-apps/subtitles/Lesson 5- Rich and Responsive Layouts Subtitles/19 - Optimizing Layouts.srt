Now that you know how to create an

0:00:01.770,0:00:05.410
arbitrarily complex nested layout, it's important to understand

0:00:05.410,0:00:08.109
that they don't come for free. Once again,

0:00:08.109,0:00:10.965
the resource constraints of the platform spoil the party.

0:00:10.965,0:00:15.351
[SOUND] Inflating complex layouts can be expensive, potentially

0:00:15.351,0:00:19.427
impacting the performance and responsiveness of your app.

0:00:19.427,0:00:21.765
So there are two good rules of thumb

0:00:21.765,0:00:25.620
to help. First, keep your layout shallow and wide,

0:00:25.620,0:00:28.930
rather than deep and narrow. That means you're better

0:00:28.930,0:00:32.490
off with more siblings and fewer children. Because it's

0:00:32.490,0:00:34.970
never as simple as that, you also want to

0:00:34.970,0:00:38.930
avoid having excessive views. In the most general terms, that

0:00:38.930,0:00:42.430
means your activities' full hierarchy should never have more

0:00:42.430,0:00:45.450
than ten nested views or over 80 views in

0:00:45.450,0:00:48.590
total. That probably sounds like a lot, but let's

0:00:48.590,0:00:51.350
open up the Hierarchy Viewer tool in Android studio and

0:00:51.350,0:00:53.170
see just how quickly that can add up
