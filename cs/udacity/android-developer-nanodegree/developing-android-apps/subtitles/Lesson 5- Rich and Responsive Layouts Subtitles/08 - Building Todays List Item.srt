0:00:00.130,0:00:03.630
Next, we'll create the Today List Item. Since this layer is different from

0:00:03.630,0:00:07.790
the other list items, we're going to need to create a new XML file under

0:00:07.790,0:00:12.730
the resources layout folder. Use the same place holder image as you did before.

0:00:12.730,0:00:18.250
Also use the same IDs that you declared in the list_ item_forecas_xml file.

0:00:18.250,0:00:21.152
For example, in our code we called this list item icon, and

0:00:21.152,0:00:25.110
we callled this list item date text view. So we use those same ID's for

0:00:25.110,0:00:29.390
the elements in this XML file. You'll see why when we introduce view holders

0:00:29.390,0:00:33.180
later. After you've finished adding it, make sure the app still compiles.

0:00:33.180,0:00:35.410
You won't see any visual difference until the next step.
