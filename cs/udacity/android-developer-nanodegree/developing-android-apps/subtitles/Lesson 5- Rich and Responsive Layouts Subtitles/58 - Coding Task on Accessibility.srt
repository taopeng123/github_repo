To evaluate how accessible any app is, you

0:00:02.890,0:00:06.160
can step through the Accessibility Testing Checklist. Some of

0:00:06.160,0:00:08.940
those steps will involve changing the accessibility settings in

0:00:08.940,0:00:11.100
the setting's app. A user will be able to

0:00:11.100,0:00:14.800
choose from these options. We have Talkback, Captions,

0:00:14.800,0:00:18.050
Magnification, increased font size, and more. I want to point

0:00:18.050,0:00:22.140
out one item in particular, Talkback service. Blind and

0:00:22.140,0:00:25.090
low vision users can turn on the Talkback service.

0:00:25.090,0:00:28.340
It allows them to navigate around the device with spoken feedback

0:00:28.340,0:00:31.260
as they interact with each UI element on the screen. There

0:00:31.260,0:00:34.310
are slightly different gestures, for example, to select or to focus

0:00:34.310,0:00:36.620
on an item. If it's the first time you turn it

0:00:36.620,0:00:39.490
on, there will be a tutorial that you can step through.

0:00:39.490,0:00:42.780
When the user navigates to these elements, Talkback service will read

0:00:42.780,0:00:46.180
aloud the context description provided. Every UI component that doesn't have

0:00:46.180,0:00:47.960
any visible text has a content

0:00:47.960,0:00:50.710
description. Using Talkback or another accessibility

0:00:50.710,0:00:54.270
tool from the checklist will let the sunshine out. Find and fix at least one

0:00:54.270,0:00:56.660
accessibility issue in the app. Then please share

0:00:56.660,0:00:58.250
what you did in the class discussion forum.
