To finish [INAUDIBLE] to do we modify the

0:00:02.530,0:00:05.350
new view method to choose layout ID based on

0:00:05.350,0:00:08.080
view type. If the view type is today then

0:00:08.080,0:00:10.880
we use this resource ID. This points to the

0:00:10.880,0:00:14.430
layout xml file list item forecast today. If the

0:00:14.430,0:00:16.350
list type is for a future day, then we

0:00:16.350,0:00:19.380
use this resource ID. This points to the list

0:00:19.380,0:00:22.680
item forecast layout xml. Then we inflate that layout.
