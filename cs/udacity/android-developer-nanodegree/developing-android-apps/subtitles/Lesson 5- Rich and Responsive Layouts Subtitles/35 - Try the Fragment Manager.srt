We use the FragmentManager to begin a transaction, to look that

0:00:02.940,0:00:05.580
we want to add this transaction to the back stack, and

0:00:05.580,0:00:09.170
then use the replace command, specifying the container ID, whose contents

0:00:09.170,0:00:11.590
we want to replace, and the new fragment we want to

0:00:11.590,0:00:14.700
put in there. And we execute the transaction by calling commit.

0:00:14.700,0:00:18.070
Now you can actually chain another of changes within the same

0:00:18.070,0:00:21.160
transaction, so it's also possible to achieve much of the same

0:00:21.160,0:00:25.770
effect by first removing the contents of container A and adding fragment

0:00:25.770,0:00:27.010
B to that container.
