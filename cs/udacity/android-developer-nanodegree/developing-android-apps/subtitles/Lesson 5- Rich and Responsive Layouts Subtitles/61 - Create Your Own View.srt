Now let's take this opportunity to go ahead and create our

0:00:03.070,0:00:05.960
own custom view. And we don't need one in particular for

0:00:05.960,0:00:09.320
sunshine, so you can go ahead and choose anything. Personally, I'm

0:00:09.320,0:00:12.240
a fan of compass control, so that's what I've been building. You'll

0:00:12.240,0:00:15.820
need to include three constructors to support your view being created

0:00:15.820,0:00:19.660
in code through a resource or through inflation, then simply override the

0:00:19.660,0:00:23.550
onMeasure method and set your dimensions. Click here when you're done,

0:00:23.550,0:00:26.280
and, you're ready to get started drawing the contents of your gear.
