We build a wider detail fragment layout, using a

0:00:02.250,0:00:06.310
horizontal linear layout composed of three vertical linear layouts. This

0:00:06.310,0:00:08.280
is what the XML code looks like. And you

0:00:08.280,0:00:11.020
can see it linked below. Then we use layout aliasing

0:00:11.020,0:00:14.232
to override the fragment detail layout. In the values-land

0:00:14.232,0:00:20.100
and values-sw600dp folders, we create res.xml files. In both files,

0:00:20.100,0:00:23.200
we alias fragment detail through fragment detail wide. And

0:00:23.200,0:00:25.550
now we have a more responsive layout to wider screens.
