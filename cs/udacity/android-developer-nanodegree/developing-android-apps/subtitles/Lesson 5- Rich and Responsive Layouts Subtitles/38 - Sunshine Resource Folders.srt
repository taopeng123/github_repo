If you open up the documentation, you can see a

0:00:02.560,0:00:06.100
couple of examples of typical screen widths. Then it suggests how

0:00:06.100,0:00:08.260
you can setup your layout folders, so that you can

0:00:08.260,0:00:12.100
have a different mean activity layout for tablets versus for handsets.

0:00:12.100,0:00:14.940
And here we define tablets as having a smallest width

0:00:14.940,0:00:18.380
of at least 600 dp. To customize the UI further, we

0:00:18.380,0:00:22.400
can create a layout-sw720dp folder. That way, we can have a

0:00:22.400,0:00:25.680
different main activity layout for ten inch tablets versus for seven

0:00:25.680,0:00:29.140
inch tablets versus for handsets. So back to

0:00:29.140,0:00:33.130
our quiz. We need to define activity_main.xml file in

0:00:33.130,0:00:35.630
our base layout folder so that we can accomplish

0:00:35.630,0:00:37.840
this layout on the phone. This layout applies to

0:00:37.840,0:00:40.840
both phone, portrait, and landscape, so we don't need

0:00:40.840,0:00:42.755
a special version of the layout in the layout

0:00:42.755,0:00:46.704
lan folder. We do also need to declare activitymain.xml

0:00:46.704,0:00:50.680
in the layout-sw600dp folder. That way it will override

0:00:50.680,0:00:54.240
the one pane UI and use a two pane UI in this case. It will be

0:00:54.240,0:00:56.430
picked up on devices that have greater than

0:00:56.430,0:00:58.760
600 gp in both width and height. That

0:00:58.760,0:01:01.440
means seven inch and ten inch devices in

0:01:01.440,0:01:04.140
both portrait and landscape mode. And lastly, we

0:01:04.140,0:01:07.870
don't need layout-sw720dp because we don't have different

0:01:07.870,0:01:10.480
layouts for seven inch versus ten inch devices.
