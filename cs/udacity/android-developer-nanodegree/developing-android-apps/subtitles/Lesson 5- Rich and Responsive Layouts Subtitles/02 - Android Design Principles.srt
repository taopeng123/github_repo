Enchant me. Simplify my life. Make me amazing. They're

0:00:05.044,0:00:09.530
incredibly one-sided wedding vows, and the three key principles

0:00:09.530,0:00:12.380
underlying the Android team's creative vision for the platform

0:00:12.380,0:00:14.840
and the apps that run on it. As engineers,

0:00:14.840,0:00:16.860
it can sometimes be difficult to see past our

0:00:16.860,0:00:19.710
own delight at harnessing the power of an sdk

0:00:19.710,0:00:22.960
to bend a machine to our will, but ultimately,

0:00:22.960,0:00:26.430
our goal must be to create that same empowering experience

0:00:26.430,0:00:29.660
for our users. And we do that by creating apps

0:00:29.660,0:00:32.320
that are as esthetically pleasing as they are functional and

0:00:32.320,0:00:35.240
easy to use. Users judge the quality of your app

0:00:35.240,0:00:38.390
within the first 30 seconds. It may not be fair,

0:00:38.390,0:00:41.480
but a disproportionate amount of that judgement will be based

0:00:41.480,0:00:44.533
not on the functionality, but on the visual aesthetics. Does

0:00:44.533,0:00:48.330
it look polished? Does it look professional? How easy is

0:00:48.330,0:00:51.800
it to use? More than just looking pretty, the entire user

0:00:51.800,0:00:55.490
experience is critically important. With 30 seconds to

0:00:55.490,0:00:58.505
win users over, it's critical that that onboarding process

0:00:58.505,0:01:01.520
the time and effort required to go from downloading

0:01:01.520,0:01:04.420
your app to performing it's main function should be

0:01:04.420,0:01:07.800
as short and frictionless as possible. Not only

0:01:07.800,0:01:10.390
that, but a well designed app should evoke a

0:01:10.390,0:01:14.530
visceral reaction that speaks to the subconscious. It should

0:01:14.530,0:01:17.020
be fun to use. It should surprise in delightful

0:01:17.020,0:01:20.590
ways through subtle animations and smooth transitions that contribute

0:01:20.590,0:01:23.890
to a feeling of power and effortlessness. It should

0:01:23.890,0:01:27.000
let users touch and interact with objects directly rather

0:01:27.000,0:01:29.490
than having to use buttons and menus. And it should

0:01:29.490,0:01:31.660
use rich imagery and pictures in place of lots

0:01:31.660,0:01:34.370
of words and long sentences. It allows users to

0:01:34.370,0:01:37.440
customize your app, to make it theirs while providing

0:01:37.440,0:01:41.805
beautiful and sensible defaults. Create something that works like magic,

0:01:41.805,0:01:44.430
learning your preference in the context provided by

0:01:44.430,0:01:47.260
the device so it never asks users for information

0:01:47.260,0:01:51.300
that they've already provided. Provide simple shortcuts to complete

0:01:51.300,0:01:55.460
complex tasks, and remember data settings and customizations making

0:01:55.460,0:01:58.750
them available across every device. While it's good practice

0:01:58.750,0:02:01.320
to create a familiar and welcoming experience by creating

0:02:01.320,0:02:03.630
a look and feel that's consistent with the platforms

0:02:03.630,0:02:06.810
styles and themes, it's just as important to remember

0:02:06.810,0:02:09.710
that this, and all the other principles I've discussed

0:02:09.710,0:02:12.270
here, are really just a starting point for your

0:02:12.270,0:02:16.190
own creative vision. Deviation from the guidelines is encouraged,

0:02:16.190,0:02:19.500
but when you do do so, deviate with purpose.
