Andy Rubin, head of Google's Android team in 2013,

0:00:04.200,0:00:07.540
famously defined Android's openness with this Tweet, offering the

0:00:07.540,0:00:10.500
instructions for downloading and building the Android source code.

0:00:11.840,0:00:14.020
As app developers, it's handy to be able to peep

0:00:14.020,0:00:16.530
behind the curtains and see how the framework actually

0:00:16.530,0:00:19.070
works. And it's an excellent way to find answers to

0:00:19.070,0:00:22.230
tricky, Stack Overflow questions. But the Android Open Source

0:00:22.230,0:00:25.580
Project, or AOSP as its commonly known, is much more

0:00:25.580,0:00:28.170
than that. The source code is available under the

0:00:28.170,0:00:31.000
Apache 2 license, so anyone can take it and do

0:00:31.000,0:00:34.290
anything they want with it, including modifying it and redistributing

0:00:34.290,0:00:37.830
it. And they have. Android has always had a passionate

0:00:37.830,0:00:40.945
community of modders, from Steve Kondik and the Cyanogen community

0:00:40.945,0:00:44.240
to XDA and many others who have been distributing modified

0:00:44.240,0:00:47.100
images of Android for phone owners brave enough to try

0:00:47.100,0:00:50.580
them. Even big companies like Amazon have taken the Android

0:00:50.580,0:00:52.500
source code and modified it for use in their own

0:00:52.500,0:00:56.420
line of products. That openness extends to the apps themselves, the

0:00:56.420,0:00:59.790
AOSP includes key mobile apps like the dialer, app launcher,

0:00:59.790,0:01:03.170
calendar, and email. And Google offers it own versions of each

0:01:03.170,0:01:06.000
as well. In the early days those native apps were

0:01:06.000,0:01:08.870
tightly bound to the framework and could only get updated along

0:01:08.870,0:01:12.170
with the platform. Which admittedly in the early days seemed like

0:01:12.170,0:01:16.230
every few weeks. But as the time between platform releases grew,

0:01:16.230,0:01:18.860
so did the efforts to unbundle those apps, allowing

0:01:18.860,0:01:21.840
them to be updated through Google Play. That was great

0:01:21.840,0:01:23.670
news for users, but it had an even better

0:01:23.670,0:01:27.140
side effect for us developers. Because apps like Gmail and

0:01:27.140,0:01:30.170
Maps depend on a number of proprietary Google APIs,

0:01:30.170,0:01:34.140
Google released Google Play Services. Also code named after food

0:01:34.140,0:01:36.920
to support the Google apps, while also giving us

0:01:36.920,0:01:41.850
developers Google specific APIs, like Maps, Wallet, Drive, and YouTube.

0:01:41.850,0:01:44.480
So now we get the latest and greatest Google specific APIs

0:01:44.480,0:01:47.110
every six weeks or so. And rather than being tied to

0:01:47.110,0:01:51.540
a specific platform, they're available on every device, back to Gingerbread.

0:01:51.540,0:01:55.580
Oh, and of course every native app is also entirely replaceable.

0:01:55.580,0:01:57.830
So you can publish apps to replace any of the apps

0:01:57.830,0:02:00.490
shipped with the device. And we can build our own SMS

0:02:00.490,0:02:03.910
apps, homescreens or maps apps, publish it on Play and give

0:02:03.910,0:02:07.070
users the choice to make it their default. When Android was first

0:02:07.070,0:02:10.550
announced, Andy Rubin described the AOSP as, all the software

0:02:10.550,0:02:13.340
to run a mobile phone but without the proprietary obstacles

0:02:13.340,0:02:16.860
that have hindered mobile innovation. Today, Android runs on more

0:02:16.860,0:02:19.580
than just mobiles, but the core of its purpose remains

0:02:19.580,0:02:23.383
the same. A platform and ecosystem that allows models, carriers,

0:02:23.383,0:02:26.470
OEMs and app developers to innovate and compete. So, armed

0:02:26.470,0:02:29.560
with an open, evolving platform enriched by a growing set

0:02:29.560,0:02:32.380
of Google API's and the ability to create great apps

0:02:32.380,0:02:34.470
that let users customize every aspect of

0:02:34.470,0:02:37.270
their user experience, you can use other people's

0:02:37.270,0:02:39.640
work to help define the computing platform of

0:02:39.640,0:02:42.870
the future. And that's my definition of open.
