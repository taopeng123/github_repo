We created the today layout so why doesn't it show

0:00:02.250,0:00:06.910
up? The reason is because we're using a simple CursorAdapter. Remember

0:00:06.910,0:00:08.960
that it creates a list item for every row in the

0:00:08.960,0:00:12.740
cursor but it only supports one item view type. That means

0:00:12.740,0:00:15.970
that all list items must use the same layout. If

0:00:15.970,0:00:18.640
we want today's forecast to look differently we're going to need

0:00:18.640,0:00:22.120
to create a custom CursorAdapter. That way we can have multiple

0:00:22.120,0:00:25.540
item view types. Then we can have different list item layouts

0:00:25.540,0:00:28.130
based on what row of the cursor we're looking at.

0:00:28.130,0:00:30.530
Note that the concept of item view types applies to

0:00:30.530,0:00:34.280
adapters in general, not just the CursorAdapter. If you open

0:00:34.280,0:00:37.730
up the documentation for CursorAdapter, you'll see that it's an abstract

0:00:37.730,0:00:40.640
class. It contains two abstract methods that you'll need to

0:00:40.640,0:00:45.052
override. The bindView method as well as the newView method.

0:00:45.052,0:00:47.260
The newView method knows how to return a new list

0:00:47.260,0:00:50.560
item layout, but doesn't contain data yet. The bindView method knows

0:00:50.560,0:00:52.670
how to take an existing layout and update

0:00:52.670,0:00:54.660
it with the data pointed to by the cursor
