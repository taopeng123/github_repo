0:00:00.310,0:00:01.870
So, we know we need to create layouts

0:00:01.870,0:00:04.770
and assets optimized for different screen pixel densities

0:00:04.770,0:00:07.320
and sizes. So, now's a great time to

0:00:07.320,0:00:12.130
introduce you to the Android resource framework. All externalized

0:00:12.130,0:00:15.660
Android resources, everything from strings to layouts to

0:00:15.660,0:00:19.200
drawables and animations are all stored within your project's

0:00:19.200,0:00:22.490
res folder. You've already been putting your strings

0:00:22.490,0:00:25.500
in the strings.xml file stored in the values folder.

0:00:25.500,0:00:27.550
And you've been putting your layouts into the layout

0:00:27.550,0:00:31.320
folder. And you know to reference your resources using

0:00:31.320,0:00:34.450
at notation within both your xml or within the

0:00:34.450,0:00:36.617
code. And then at runtime, Android will insert the

0:00:36.617,0:00:40.520
appropriate resource for you. So far, so good. And

0:00:40.520,0:00:43.475
here's where things get a little more interesting. Android

0:00:43.475,0:00:46.740
allows you to create alternative versions of every resource

0:00:46.740,0:00:51.040
by placing them into folders with different qualifiers. We separate

0:00:51.040,0:00:54.130
each of those using a hyphen. And we can

0:00:54.130,0:00:57.320
add those qualifiers based on anything from language and

0:00:57.320,0:01:00.640
or dialect to whether the device is docked, the

0:01:00.640,0:01:02.930
type of touch screen, the pixel density of the

0:01:02.930,0:01:06.820
display, the orientation of the screen, and most importantly

0:01:06.820,0:01:09.830
for a responsive design in particular, the smallest available

0:01:09.830,0:01:12.055
screen width which you can support with that layout.

0:01:12.055,0:01:16.270
At runtime, Android will check the count device configuration,

0:01:16.270,0:01:20.030
it's language, it's screen size, pixel density, everything,

0:01:20.030,0:01:22.790
and then load the right layout strings and drawables

0:01:22.790,0:01:26.410
accordingly. You can even chain these qualifiers together. For

0:01:26.410,0:01:29.460
example, to create a different layout for German language

0:01:29.460,0:01:31.660
users to account for all of those really long

0:01:31.660,0:01:34.960
German words, or more typically for a combination of

0:01:34.960,0:01:38.660
screen size and device configuration. Now, keep in mind

0:01:38.660,0:01:41.610
that many of these values can change at runtime.

0:01:41.610,0:01:44.630
The most common change being that of orientation. And

0:01:44.630,0:01:47.190
it's for this reason that Android activities are destroyed

0:01:47.190,0:01:51.360
and recreated whenever the device configuration changes. And that's

0:01:51.360,0:01:53.940
because the layout and all of the resources within it

0:01:53.940,0:01:56.880
could be completely different based on something as simple

0:01:56.880,0:02:00.640
as screen orientation change. Now it's good practice, as

0:02:00.640,0:02:03.660
well, to localize your apps and provide translated strings

0:02:03.660,0:02:06.720
for all of your users using this mechanism. And that's

0:02:06.720,0:02:08.530
a task made a lot easier. Thanks to Google

0:02:08.530,0:02:12.270
Play Publisher site that can offer you this service. It's

0:02:12.270,0:02:15.230
also a really good idea to provide different drawables

0:02:15.230,0:02:17.800
at the appropriate pixel density, so you can get a

0:02:17.800,0:02:21.440
nice crisp image on every device. And when it

0:02:21.440,0:02:24.480
comes to providing alternative layouts, Android has gone through a

0:02:24.480,0:02:28.130
few alternative models. Starting in the early days, with this

0:02:28.130,0:02:32.110
screen buckets idea of small, normal large, and extra large.

0:02:32.110,0:02:36.130
But, since Android 3.2, the new smallest width qualifier has

0:02:36.130,0:02:39.830
given us much more fine grain control over our layouts.
