There's a number of reasons you'd be potentially better

0:00:02.270,0:00:05.180
off breaking your app into different activities. Having a

0:00:05.180,0:00:09.760
single monolithic activity increases the complexity of your code,

0:00:09.760,0:00:12.370
making the creation and management of intent filters much

0:00:12.370,0:00:15.470
harder and making it more difficult to maintain, test,

0:00:15.470,0:00:18.740
and read your activity code. It also increases the

0:00:18.740,0:00:22.660
risk of tightly coupling independent components and makes it

0:00:22.660,0:00:25.190
much more likely to introduce security risks if the

0:00:25.190,0:00:29.150
single activity includes both sensitive information and information that's safe

0:00:29.150,0:00:31.650
to share. A good rule of thumb is to create a

0:00:31.650,0:00:35.260
new activity whenever the context changes. For example, displaying a

0:00:35.260,0:00:38.530
different kind of data, while switching from viewing to entering data.
