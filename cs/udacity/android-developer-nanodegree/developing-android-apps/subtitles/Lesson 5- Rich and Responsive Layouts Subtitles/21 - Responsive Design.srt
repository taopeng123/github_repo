0:00:00.200,0:00:03.890
Okay. So now we have the wireframes implemented for both screens.

0:00:03.890,0:00:07.080
But what does it look like on the tablet? Well, unfortunately,

0:00:07.080,0:00:08.920
when we take the phone UI and stretch it out on

0:00:08.920,0:00:11.630
a tablet, it doesn't look that great. There's a lot of empty

0:00:11.630,0:00:14.690
white space here. We could better take advantage of this screen

0:00:14.690,0:00:18.860
real estate by showing more useful information. For example, why do the

0:00:18.860,0:00:21.310
details need to be a tap away when they could just

0:00:21.310,0:00:25.380
as easily fit on this screen? And, furthermore, if the user wants

0:00:25.380,0:00:27.850
to look through the full list of forecasts, their eyes

0:00:27.850,0:00:32.380
must go like this, which is an unpleasant reading experience. If

0:00:32.380,0:00:34.960
we want the user to read some content, we should keep

0:00:34.960,0:00:38.340
the width narrower, so that they can scan it quickly. These

0:00:38.340,0:00:40.080
considerations are part of responsive

0:00:40.080,0:00:42.400
design. Responsive design means designing your

0:00:42.400,0:00:45.190
app by keeping in mind that it'll be used across a

0:00:45.190,0:00:48.230
range of different device screen sizes. But how do we do

0:00:48.230,0:00:50.540
that, and what does it mean to build for larger screen

0:00:50.540,0:00:53.700
devices like tablets. Well, I can show you some examples of

0:00:53.700,0:00:57.420
how apps adapt using multi-pane layouts. In the Android Design Guide,

0:00:57.420,0:01:01.000
there's a section on multi-pane layouts. One technique is to combine

0:01:01.000,0:01:04.000
multiple views together. For example, in the People app, you have

0:01:04.000,0:01:07.800
the contact list and the contact card for additional details. On

0:01:07.800,0:01:10.240
the tablet, we can put them side by side. This is

0:01:10.240,0:01:13.120
also known as the master detail flow. This is the master

0:01:13.120,0:01:15.580
list and this is the detail pane. In the settings app,

0:01:15.580,0:01:18.310
we have another example. The column width adjust based on the

0:01:18.310,0:01:21.430
available screen width. In the calendar app, we have panels, and

0:01:21.430,0:01:25.170
they stack vertically in the portrait orientation but horizontally in the

0:01:25.170,0:01:28.650
landscape orientation. There also a couple of other examples that you

0:01:28.650,0:01:31.550
can look through as well. If you want more information on

0:01:31.550,0:01:35.020
designing for tablets or responsive design in general, you can check

0:01:35.020,0:01:38.140
out the links below for more details. In this course, we're

0:01:38.140,0:01:40.390
learning how to build up the phone UI first, and then the

0:01:40.390,0:01:42.740
tablet UI. But in reality, when we're designing

0:01:42.740,0:01:44.970
it, we thought about responsive design from day

0:01:44.970,0:01:47.010
one. When you're building your own app, it's

0:01:47.010,0:01:49.550
bad practice to just completely design and build

0:01:49.550,0:01:51.390
your phone app and then start to brainstorm

0:01:51.390,0:01:53.810
about the tablet UI. That's because the tablet

0:01:53.810,0:01:55.780
UI often has an impact on the phone

0:01:55.780,0:01:58.510
design, as well as the architectural decisions made here.
