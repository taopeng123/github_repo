As you know, there's always more changes that we wish

0:00:03.380,0:00:05.873
we could do, if we just had a little more time.

0:00:05.873,0:00:08.458
We're going to leave those as exercises to you, if you want to

0:00:08.458,0:00:12.200
keep polishing up. For example, for simplicity, we had all tablet

0:00:12.200,0:00:16.434
sizes and orientations use the same layout. However, 7 inch portrait

0:00:16.434,0:00:19.273
would actually look better as a one pin UI. So you

0:00:19.273,0:00:22.768
can modify your resource folders to make 7 inch portrait use

0:00:22.768,0:00:26.220
the phone layout. You can also tweak the two pane behavior

0:00:26.220,0:00:29.200
so that the today layout is auto selected when you first launch the

0:00:29.200,0:00:33.420
app. Also, this should just say today instead of having the full date. That

0:00:33.420,0:00:36.880
way, it'll look more like the other items. As you play around with the

0:00:36.880,0:00:40.480
app, feel free to make changes you think would help improve the user experience.
